                              <p> Long ago, there lived a leader in a village. This leader had a
                                    very beautiful daughter. Many, many men worked for this leader
                                    as laborers. One of them saw the ruler’s daughter and he fell in
                                    love. This woman also liked him but the leader found out. He was
                                    upset at this and wanted to kill his laborer. In this village
                                    there was a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> with three heads that looked truly evil. This <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> often
                                    killed young women and ate them. One day, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> spoke. It
                                    wanted the leader to give his daughter up for the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> to eat.
                                    It said that if the leader did not listen, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> would
                                    destroy the village and everything else. This leader did not
                                    want to give up his daughter to die. So he stood up and spoke to
                                    the laborer who loved his daughter. He said, “If you can kill
                                    this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> then
                                    I will let you marry my daughter.” So the laborer dressed like a
                                    woman and then went to the place where the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> lived.
                                    When the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    came out, he thought that he was a young woman and he wanted to
                                    eat him. Each person from the village was hiding and waiting to
                                    see what would happen, they were afraid and cried for the young
                                    man. But the young laborer was not afraid. He quickly held one
                                    of the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s
                                    heads and cut it right off with a knife. He also did this with
                                    the other two heads and killed the <span style="color: red;"

                                    came and saw this and was happy that the evil woman-eating <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> had died.
                                    They carried the body of the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> to their village. They made a
                                    feast and danced and sang. The young laborer carried some of the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s
                                    body back to show to the leader, his girlfriend’s father. The
                                    leader followed through on his promise and gave his daughter to
                                    this youth. The two of them married. Some days later, the two of
                                    them went to a garden and buried all of the pieces of the <span

                                    various spots. A while later, they saw a new kind of thing
                                    growing in the places where they had buried the heads of the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> .
                                    Tree-like plants were growing that looked like <span

                                    They cut these and tried eating them and they were deliciously
                                    sweet. So they called this “sugar” because it is sweet. </p>

                              <p> Ali is the name of an island, on this island there is a small
                                    village named Malung [Ali People, West Sepik Province]. This
                                    village once did not have a permanent water supply for cooking
                                    food. The ancestors were only able to get water from rain. When
                                    it did not rain, they had no water. One time, there was an old
                                    man from Malung Village who went walking along the beach. He saw
                                    a black <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> .
                                    It was a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> raven </span>
                                    . The man went down to a place and hid while looking at this
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> raven </span> .
                                    This <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> raven </span> was
                                    making a small well. When the man saw this he walked closer to
                                    the well. Then the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          raven </span> saw the old man and flew to the top of a
                                    tall tree, called tau. From the top of the tree, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> raven </span> looked at
                                    the man walking straight to the well. The old man saw that there
                                    was still a stone in this well, which he tried to remove. The
                                    man removed the stone and when he saw the water inside it, he
                                    was ecstatic. When the old man returned home, he did not tell
                                    the other people about this well. Each time he went to his
                                    garden or to any other place, he shut his house tightly. He did
                                    not like other people going inside his house. So one time, some
                                    of the old men and women saw him shutting up his house to leave.
                                    He was going to get some water from the well again. One of the
                                    old men went to hide and saw him going straight to this well.
                                    After he finished getting water from the well, he hid the well
                                    with tree leaves. The old man who was hiding saw this and
                                    returned home where he told the other old people of the village.
                                    So after they were told about the well, they all went to see it
                                    and they drank from it. The water was sweeter than the rainwater
                                    that they had been drinking. When the old man returned, he was
                                    incensed at them because they had taken his water. But they told
                                    him that the water belonged to everyone. This well still exists
                                    in Malung Village on Ali Island. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, in the time of the ancestors, there was only daytime.
                                    The ancestors said that there was never night time. They never
                                    slept at night. No, they only sat under the big sun. They would
                                    go to get food in the forest and return to the village, they ate
                                    the food, and then went to get more food in the forest again,
                                    just like now. One man went and cut a sago palm tree, he scraped
                                    and processed it with his wife. His wife rinsed the sago. The
                                    husband told his wife, “Rinse the sago.” Meanwhile, the husband
                                    went to find some marsupials {kapul) that often slept in caves.
                                    He went to find them, he looked and looked, but could not find a
                                    single marsupial. So, he went to collect some water from the
                                    spur of a ton tree. Then the man wondered, “Is that water used
                                    by birds, do they come to bathe there?” However, it was not a
                                    birdbath. No, it was the water where the sun came to bathe. Then
                                    this ancestor, who thought that it was just a birdbath, built a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span>
                                    blind nearby then he returned home. At home he got his bow and
                                    arrows and returned to the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> blind where he hid and kept
                                    watch. He watched and watched, then he thought, “If the birds
                                    come and bathe in this water, I will shoot them.” Instead, he
                                    saw the sun arrive as if it were a real man while he was
                                    watching the water. The man saw the sun bathe in this water, and
                                    the man trembled at the sun. After the sun finished bathing, he
                                    returned home. Later when the sun wanted to bathe, the man was
                                    sitting in the blind and watching. The sun came down to bathe in
                                    the water, and the man stood and shot him. The sun died and
                                    darkness arrived everywhere. That is the end of the story about
                                    the sun and how darkness came. </p>

                              <p> In the time of the ancestors, there was a man with two dogs. One
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> was
                                    white and the other black. These two dogs went with the man to
                                    sleep in the forest. When it was time for the dogs to hunt for
                                    wild game, the white <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> would kill the game and then bring it back to
                                    this man. But the black <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> did not do this. The black <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> never
                                    killed any game. So the owner of the dogs only liked the white
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> , and
                                    he gave food to this <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> all of the time. The black <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> just slept
                                    about, and the man never gave food to it because it never found
                                    any game. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> just slept in the house. So, the black <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> was always
                                    hungry and it was always angry. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> waited for the man to be asleep
                                    at night. When the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> saw the man sleeping, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> made a big bonfire near the
                                    man’s body to heat up the man. The man was sound asleep. Then
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> went to
                                    get the sacred masks and returned with them. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> raised the
                                    sleeping man along with his bed, carried him and put him in the
                                    pond. The man slept and slept, then he felt cold. So, the man
                                    tried to find the fire to warm his body. He moved his arm to try
                                    to find the fire, but he could not find it. He put his hand into
                                    the water instead. He moved his other hand but could not find
                                    the fire either. The man was surprised, so he woke up, took his
                                    handflute and blew it towards the village. The men of the
                                    village heard the flute playing and they came to see this man
                                    who was lying far below in the pond. They cut a large vine and
                                    threw it out to him. The man caught the vine, and he tied it to
                                    his bed, then the men pulled the man back to shore. The men were
                                    angry at this black <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> . The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> knew this and went to hide in among some thorny sago
                                    palm trees. Because of this, the men could not kill the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> . But the
                                    white <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    harried out the black <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> , and the men killed the black <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> , but
                                    instantly the owner also died. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, among my ancestors, there was a brother and sister
                                    who lived on an island called Dangtiti. They left this island
                                    and wanted to go to another. When they rowed off, they came upon
                                    a reef. The name of this reef is Aillwo, meaning “Seaweed.” Then
                                    the two of them went directly towards an island while the waves
                                    began to come inside their canoe. The sister heard the water
                                    sloshing inside the canoe and looked behind her. She thought
                                    that her brother had broken wind. But no, it was just the waves
                                    going inside the canoe. The brother saw that it was the sea, and
                                    his sister saw it too now and was quite ashamed. So the man told
                                    his sister, “I’m going to leave you now. You should tell the men
                                    of the village about me.” So the brother took his basket and
                                    spear and went into Aillwo Reef where he stood upon a piece of
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> coral </span> .
                                    He spoke to his sister again, “When you go to the village, tell
                                    the men to go to the top of the mountain and get a large piece
                                    of tree bark. Tell them to make a net from the bark and fetch me
                                    with the net.” The brother finished talking to the sister, then
                                    he dove into the sea and became a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dolphin </span> . The poor woman cried
                                    because she had thought that her brother would return right away
                                    after he jumped into the sea. But no, the boy turned into a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dolphin </span> .
                                    The woman went to the village and spoke about what had happened.
                                    Then the men got up and went to the mountain, got some logs and
                                    began making nets from the bark. This is a true story. If you go
                                    to Pililo Island, you will see a big net [West New Britain
                                    Province, Arawe People]. And if you go to Aillwo Reef, you will
                                    see the seaweed and the many bonbon, or dolphins. Whenever it is
                                    a holiday like Easter or Christmas, the men go in their large
                                    canoes with their large nets and catch dolphins in them. The
                                    time to catch dolphins is only at night. If you want to find out
                                    for yourself about this story, you can go to Pililo Island and
                                    see the big nets that are there today. </p>

                              <p> A woman and her newborn child were staying in their house. Her
                                    husband went with some other people to a festival at another
                                    village. At night there was a flying <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> that was eating some fruit near
                                    the house. But it was not a real flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> , it was a
                                    spirit in disguise. The woman thought it was a real flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> so she
                                    scolded it. The spirit told her, “Heat that pot in the fire.”
                                    So, the woman heated the pot in the fire. The flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> said, “Half
                                    will be cooked and the other half will not be.” The woman said,
                                    “Oh my! The spirit is going to eat me.” Then the flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> came inside
                                    the house with her, and the two of them fought bitterly. The
                                    flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span>
                                    killed her and ate her along with her infant, then the flying
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> put
                                    their bones inside the house. His sister cut the bones and
                                    brought them to throw at her husband who was at the festival.
                                    She threw the bones on top of his head. He thought, “What is
                                    this that’s fallen on my head?” When he saw what it was, he
                                    said, “Oh, my wife is bad. I must leave.” He brought his sister
                                    with him and returned to their village. He went and saw a pile
                                    of sago pulp, then he shoved his sister underneath the sago
                                    pulp. He went to look for his wife, but she was not to be found.
                                    Then he went back to get his sister, but she was not there
                                    either. She had become like a mushroom. So now, one can find
                                    mushrooms growing in the pulp of sago while women process it.

                              <p> This story tells how fire first came to the men of Gope
                                    [North-Eastern Kiwai] People in the Gulf Province. Many hundred
                                    years ago, the men of Gope put their food in the sun to burn it
                                    first. They did not know about fire, but there were some insects
                                    and wild game who dreamt of fire. Once, the sun was shining
                                    brightly and there were no clouds in the sky. At the seashore,
                                    it was high tide and the sea shone like a polished stone. The
                                    sun rose above all of the trees and mountains. In one muddy
                                    pond, there was a small <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          crab </span> sleeping under a mangrove root. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> was trying
                                    to molt into a new shell, and waiting for the new shell to
                                    harden. Suddenly, on top of the mangrove tree, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> heard a
                                    “pop.” A fruit of the mangrove had fallen on the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> ’s new
                                    shell. The small, vain <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          crab </span> cried and cried, “Rat! Rat! Rat! Come here
                                    and eat this mangrove fruit. It has fallen on top of my new skin
                                    and has also broken my flesh.” The mangrove fruit is good food
                                    for rats, and so it was not long that a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> came and
                                    sat on top of the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab
                                    </span> ’s shell and began to eat this fruit. The mangrove fruit
                                    cried with pain, “Fire! Fire! Fire! Come and help me. Bum this
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> who
                                    is trying to eat me.” However, there was no man who knew about
                                    fire, but the fruit had heard the insects talking about their
                                    dreams of fire coming to burn the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> rat </span> . Instantly, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> ’s hair
                                    turned to ashes. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          rat </span> cried out, “Water! Water! Water! Where are
                                    you? Come and douse this fire that is burning my hair.” The
                                    Water heard this shouting, then came and doused the fire. Much
                                    later, the fire called out, “Snake! Snake! Snake! Where are you?
                                    Come and help me. Bring me to the other side of the pond. It is
                                    bad that water is making me die out.” The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> came,
                                    fetched the fire and swam to another place. The young men and
                                    women were sitting down and sunning themselves. They saw the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    swimming straight towards them with the fire. The women called
                                    this new thing, “fire.” Later the women said, “Fire, don’t die
                                    out. Fire, don’t die out. Fire don’t die out.” But the young men
                                    competed with the women, and they sang out stronger, “Fire die!
                                    Fire die! Fire die!” Then the young women sang out stronger
                                    still, and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> came ashore with the fire. A woman went to get the fire
                                    from the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    . Then all of the girls gathered pieces of wood near the pond to
                                    make a bonfire. Later, each of them took a piece of the fire and
                                    brought it to their families. The young women won the contest,
                                    so this made the young men angry at the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> . They
                                    brought some weapons to kill the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> . The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> was
                                    terrified and ran away into the forest. So that is how fire came
                                    to the Gope People. Girls held the fire first, and they kept if
                                    from dying out, so now it is the job of women to cook food in
                                    the fire. If the men had said, “Fire, don’t die,” then now it
                                    would be the men’s job to cook food and not the women’s job.

                              <p> Once, a great sickness came to my island, Tro wain [Tarawai]
                                    Island. Many people died all over the island [Boiken People,
                                    East Sepik Province]. At one village, everyone died except for
                                    two brothers and their two parents. The brothers’ names were
                                    Haro and Laho. One day, Haro went to his garden to fetch some
                                    yams and taros. At the same time Laho went to spear many <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> at the
                                    reef. While Laho was coming back along the trail after he had
                                    finished catching <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> , he met an old woman. The woman said to him, “Please
                                    fetch those coconuts of mine in that tree.” Laho was a good boy,
                                    so he climbed up the coconut palm. When he finished getting
                                    them, he wanted to come down. But the woman said, “You should
                                    come down head first with your feet up.” Poor Laho did this, and
                                    when he came down near the ground, the old woman took a stick
                                    and broke Laho’s head. She took the head and went to eat it with
                                    her husband. Brother Haro had been waiting for him, so he went
                                    to find him. When he came to the coconut tree, he saw the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> and the
                                    fishing spear. He also saw blood all around the coconut tree.
                                    Another time, Haro returned to that place. He saw the old woman
                                    who said to him, “Go climb that coconut tree and fetch my
                                    coconuts.” Haro climbed the tree and threw down many coconuts.
                                    The old woman said to him, “You must come down head first.” Haro
                                    was angry at that and said, “I know you. You were the one who
                                    killed my brother when he did this.” Haro came down quickly,
                                    fetched a stick and killed the old woman with it. He cut off a
                                    small piece of the woman and boiled it in one of the woman’s
                                    pots. Before long, the woman’s husband returned. He was
                                    famished, and could not wait to eat. He began to eat his wife’s
                                    cooked flesh. After he finished eating, Haro went and climbed up
                                    the coconut tree and said to the old man, “You ate the flesh of
                                    your wife.” The old man came outside his house and looked
                                    around, then he looked up and saw Haro in the coconut palm. The
                                    old man said to him, “Hey! You killed my wife!” After he
                                    finished speaking, he got his axe and started cutting the
                                    coconut tree. When the coconut tree was about to fall, Haro
                                    jumped to another tree, and the old man began cutting that tree
                                    too. Then just when that tree was about to fall, Haro jumped to
                                    yet another tree. The two of them kept doing this until all of
                                    the coconut trees were like this, then all of the other trees
                                    too. Finally, there was just one was left standing, a breadfruit
                                    tree. The old man began to cut this tree. He cut and cut, and
                                    when it was about to fall, Haro fell onto a rock and died. Then
                                    the old man ran towards Haro when he fell, but the tree fell on
                                    top of him, and he died too. Now, everyone from this place was
                                    dead, and there were no coconuts or other trees there either.
                                    Yes, that is the end of my story. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, Cassowary and Chicken were friends, they traveled
                                    together in the forest. Once as they were traveling, Cassowary
                                    said to Chicken, “Let’s carve a canoe.” So, they looked for a
                                    tree and cut one down. They began to carve the canoe. After they
                                    finished carving, they paddled it into the sea, then pulled up
                                    the mast. Cassowary said to Chicken, “Friend, sit down and I’ll
                                    paddle.” So, Cassowary paddled and paddled. Cassowary went very
                                    far and said to his friend, Chicken, “Can you help me paddle?”
                                    But Chicken was lazy and Cassowary said, “If you are too lazy
                                    then I will hit the canoe.” Cassowary asked Chicken again, but
                                    Chicken would not paddle. Cassowary was angry and hit the canoe
                                    with its leg. The canoe broke and water came inside. What would
                                    these poor birds do? Chicken looked around, then flew to the
                                    beach. But poor Cassowary went crazy and stayed with the canoe.
                                    Cassowary sat there and saw a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> turtle </span> approaching, so Cassowary
                                    spoke to the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle
                                    </span> , “Friend, please take me.” But the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> replied,
                                    “You are still walking around.” Cassowary looked at the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> and
                                    spoke again. But the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          turtle </span> replied, “You are still walking around.”
                                    Then at the last moment, the big <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> turtle </span> raised its dirty backside.
                                    Cassowary asked the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          turtle </span> , “Friend, can you take me?” So, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> brought
                                    its backside to Cassowary, and Cassowary went on top. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> carried
                                    Cassowary to the beach and Cassowary said to the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> , “Good
                                    friend, wait here. I’ll get you some food.” But Cassowary was
                                    lying to the poor <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          turtle </span> . Cassowary went and cut a vine, then
                                    brought it and tied up the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> turtle </span> to the foot of a tree. Then
                                    Cassowary asked the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          turtle </span> , “Now where are you going?” The poor <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> cried.
                                    Cassowary went to find some fruit and brought the fruits back.
                                    Cassowary hit the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          turtle </span> badly with the fruit. The poor <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> was
                                    close to dying. Cassowary did this until there was no more fruit
                                    to be thrown. Then Cassowary went to find some that were farther
                                    away. Cassowary departed, then a little siksik <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> came and
                                    broke the vines that bound the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> turtle </span> , and the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> fled.
                                    Cassowary returned and saw that the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> turtle </span> was not there anymore.
                                    Cassowary was incensed. Cassowary shouted, “Who broke the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> ’s
                                    ropes?” The little <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> was on top of a tree and cried out, “I broke the ropes!”
                                    Cassowary was irate and said, “Where do you shit?” The little
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span>
                                    said, “I shit on top of trees. Where do you shit?” Cassowary
                                    said, “I shit in the woods.” The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> said to Cassowary, “If you
                                    shit in the woods, I’ll ensorcell your shit.” So now little
                                    birds defecate on top of trees and their feces often stays
                                    there. </p>

                              <p> Once, long ago there was a place where two brothers lived. After
                                    they lived together with their father and mother for many years,
                                    all of the brother’s relatives and friends began to say that it
                                    was about time to purchase wives for these brothers. Days
                                    passed, and various valuables were brought, such as axes, shell
                                    money (kina), black birds of paradise [probably the black
                                    sicklebill, Epimachus fastuosus (Beehler et al., 1986: 227)],
                                    pigs to be slaughtered, and piglets. After the preparations were
                                    completed, they gave these things to the relatives of the two
                                    women to be married to the brothers, and then they were married.
                                    The big brother had a boy and two girls. The little brother had
                                    a boy and a girl. After some years, the younger brother became
                                    sick and died, and he was buried in a grave. The ancestors had a
                                    rule that if a man or child died, they would paint their faces
                                    with mud. After a week had passed since the young brother’s
                                    death, the older brother had not given a funeral party. He had
                                    many pigs and chickens, but he left them alone. He went inside
                                    his house and got a kina shell to trade for a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> so that he
                                    could give a party for his deceased brother. He took the kina
                                    and left. He walked to a faraway place and traded this kina for
                                    a huge <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> ,
                                    then he brought the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> back with him. But his home was far away, so he found
                                    himself in the forest as the sun set. He made himself a shelter
                                    to stay for the night. He was in the deep forest, far from any
                                    people. He made a bonfire and tied the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> up at one place while he slept
                                    at another near the fire. He wanted to close his eyes and sleep,
                                    but he could not. He just could not sleep. Many thoughts came to
                                    him, of dead men, of malevolent ghosts, of malign sorcery, of
                                    the ancestral spirits, and of his dead brother. He tossed and
                                    turned, and he wanted to forget these thoughts but he could not.
                                    He heard something outside his shelter that sounded like a man
                                    walking around. He stared at the doorway, then he saw a man
                                    enter. He saw something fastened to the man’s body. It was the
                                    same thing that was on his brother when he was buried. He now
                                    realized that he was seeing the ghost of his little brother. He
                                    trembled with utter fright, he urinated and defecated, and he
                                    broke into a sweat. But then he got up, took a burning stick
                                    from the fire and thrashed his brother’s ghost with it. He spoke
                                    to the ghost, “I had thought of you and I walked to that faraway
                                    place. Why have you come here?” He said this as he fought, and
                                    the ghost ran away. If the big brother had not chased away the
                                    ghost of his little brother, the ghost would have entered his
                                    shelter and continued to frighten him. So now when we go into
                                    the forest, the ghosts will not frighten us. All of us should
                                    give thanks for the work of this big brother. Now we can walk
                                    freely into the forest to find wild game, edible mushrooms, and
                                    many other things. Men, women, children, and old people too, all
                                    of you can go into the forest. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, Marsupial (Kapul), Rat and Man were three good friends.
                                    They played, worked, and walked together. Marsupial worked at
                                    cutting pandanus nuts (karuka) and carrying them. Rat worked at
                                    turning the earth and planting all kinds of foods. Man often ate
                                    a lot, but Marsupial and Rat ate little. One time, Marsupial and
                                    Rat talked. Rat said, “We always work hard but we don’t get much
                                    to eat. Man only works at filling his belly. I don’t like this
                                    situation. I’m tired of it.” Marsupial agreed with this and
                                    said, “Let’s break off with Man and become his enemies. If we
                                    are walking together in the sun, he’ll be able to see us. So,
                                    when the sun is out, we must hide and rest and sleep. Man sleeps
                                    at night, so that is when we should walk and find food.”
                                    Marsupial and Rat did not know how to divide their work. One
                                    went to the forest to find food. One knew how to get food there.
                                    The other went close to Man’s garden and stole Man’s sweet
                                    potatoes and other foods from his garden. Marsupial slept inside
                                    pandanus tree leaves. Rat became angry with Man. Rat hid inside
                                    Man’s house and cut up everything that belonged to him. When Man
                                    slept at night, Rat stole his food. When the pandanus trees were
                                    full of nuts, Marsupial would cut off the nuts and eat them. So
                                    then, Man cried when he saw all of these things that Rat and
                                    Marsupial had ruined. Man had no way to kill them so he thought
                                    hard. One time, he was crying and he heard something walking
                                    towards him. He looked and saw Dog approaching. Dog said, “Why
                                    are you crying?” Man told the story about Marsupial and Rat. So
                                    then, Dog was very sorry for Man and told him, “I can help you.
                                    But I’m not one who works. If you look after me and give me
                                    food, then I’ll be your friend forever and I’ll do whatever you
                                    tell me.” Man said, “I can give you food. Help me to kill
                                    Marsupial and Rat.” Dog agreed to this, then chased and
                                    surrounded Marsupial and Rat. So now, Dog helped Man a lot. That

                                    a man somewhere, they do not like it. They see the man’s face
                                    and then run away. Men know how to send their dogs after them
                                    and kill them right away. </p>

                              <p> There was a young man named Lyailelya with his sister named
                                    Tapieda Ipali. They lived together in a village called
                                    Gulipyanda in Enga Province [Enga People]. This is a true story
                                    about them. One time the man told his sister, “Now is a good
                                    time for me to find wild game in the forest. Stay here at the
                                    house.” But the sister said, “I don’t like to stay home alone. I
                                    want to come with you.” The brother said to his sister, “Who are
                                    you afraid of? You must stay at the house.” After he told his
                                    sister this, he left to find game in the forest while the young
                                    woman stayed at their house. A male ghost turned into an
                                    apparition that looked like the brother and carried game to the
                                    house. The ghost called to the young woman, “Sister, sister,
                                    I’ve returned. Come and look at the game that I killed.” The
                                    woman thought it was her real brother, so she got up and went
                                    outside. The woman thought that her brother had returned too
                                    quickly, so she asked him, “Brother, how did you kill that game?
                                    Why did you come home so quickly?” The ghost said to the woman,
                                    “I wanted to kill a lot of game, but something got in my eye, so
                                    I returned. Sister, come see what is in my eye. After you get it
                                    out, I’ll go to find more game.” The young woman thought that he
                                    was telling the truth. So, the woman went very close to the
                                    ghost and looked in his eye. Then the ghost gave her a kiss.
                                    After they kissed, the woman cried and said to him, “I’m your
                                    true sister, why did you do that to me?” The ghost smashed his
                                    head and fell to the ground, but did not say anything. Then he
                                    got up and said to the woman, “That is the first time that I
                                    found game and that I did that. I think that something bad from
                                    the forest fouled me up and made me do that bad thing to you.
                                    But now after you said that, I’m ashamed. I’ll return to the
                                    forest to find some more game.” The woman did not think that it
                                    was a ghost, she thought it was her real brother who did this,
                                    so she continued to cry. After the ghost departed, the real
                                    brother returned with plenty of game. The brother awakened her,
                                    but she looked angry and did not get up. She told her brother,
                                    “Who wants your game anyhow? You’re always shouting. You can eat
                                    it but I don’t want it.” The woman’s brother was very troubled,
                                    but he did not know that the ghost had come and done that bad
                                    thing to her. He went out and killed his <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> to pacify
                                    his sister, but he could not make her happy because of what the
                                    ghost had done. The poor brother asked her to come and eat the
                                    food, but she was strong-willed and said, “You can eat your
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> .
                                    You’re the one who likes your good <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> .” Her brother was angry and
                                    asked her, “What have I done that you are treating me this way?
                                    OK, if you don’t want to look at me then I’ll leave you.” After
                                    he said this, he took a piece of <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> ’s leg and stood outside. The
                                    grease from the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> fell to the ground and formed a pond. The sister tried
                                    to come outside, but could not. There was a big lake surrounding
                                    her brother. The woman called out, “Come here and we can marry.”
                                    But the brother was getting deeper. The woman wanted to hold him
                                    but was unable to do so. The area was flooded and her brother
                                    kept getting deeper. Later, she tried again, but she still was
                                    unable to do so. Then the water capsized a tree and killed her.
                                    The ghost did this, and the brother and sister died at this
                                    time. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was a pond. At this pond there lived a man who had
                                    only a head. Near the pond was a village. In the evening, the
                                    people of the village said that they would go look for wild game
                                    at the pond in the next morning. When morning came, the people
                                    went and they found many <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > fish </span> . By evening, there was only one man who
                                    was still looking for game. The man who only had a head was
                                    hungry, so he too went to the pond to look for game. The head
                                    saw the testicles of the man who was looking for game in the
                                    pond. The head thought that the testicles would be good meat to
                                    eat, so he took a bite. However, the man was pained by this and
                                    shouted, “Let go of my balls!” The head said, “I’m not letting
                                    go. This is my food.” The man said, “If you let go of my balls,
                                    I’ll give you a banana.” The man called out all kinds of foods
                                    to the head, but the head said, “I don’t eat those kinds of
                                    foods.” So the man called out, “Breadfruit.” The head said,
                                    “That’s my kind of food.” The man said, “OK, let go of me and we
                                    will go find some breadfruit.” The head said, “When we get some
                                    breadfruit, then I’ll let go of you.” The two of them came to a
                                    breadfruit tree, and the head said, “Let’s climb this breadfruit
                                    tree, then after you throw down some breadfruit I will go and
                                    get it.” The man climbed the breadfruit tree with the head still
                                    hanging onto his testicles. The man picked a breadfruit and
                                    threw it down. Then the head went down and got the breadfruit.
                                    The head said, “You must throw down one more.” The man threw
                                    down one more far away. While the head went to get the
                                    breadfruit, the man came down as quickly as he could and ran
                                    back to his village. When the head came back, he saw that the
                                    man had run away. So, the head took his two breadfruits and ran
                                    home to his pond. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was a brother and a sister. The brother’s
                                    name was Kuta and the sister’s name was Paiyali. They lived in a
                                    village called Yango [Kewa People, Southern Highlands]. They had
                                    a huge <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span>
                                    named Puramenalasa. They divided their work between them. The
                                    young Paiyali cooked the food, cared for the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> , looked
                                    after the garden and took care of all of the things around the
                                    house. The young Kuta killed many kinds of wild game, made
                                    fences for the garden, cut firewood, and fetched water. One day,
                                    Kuta went to the forest to look for game while Paiyali went to
                                    the garden and made mounds for planting sweet potatoes. Kuta
                                    killed a marsupial (kapul) called lake. He gutted the marsupial
                                    and put it near the garden without telling his sister, then he
                                    went to find more game. The marsupial looked up and saw the
                                    young woman making a mound for sweet potatoes. The marsupial
                                    took a tree fruit, aimed it at Paiyali’s breasts and threw it
                                    straight at them. The young woman was surprised. She saw the
                                    marsupial and beat it until it died. Paiyali was not happy and
                                    she began to cry, “Why didn’t brother tell me he had put this
                                    marsupial here?” When Kuta came to the garden and saw his sister
                                    crying, he asked her, “Hey, who hit you?” The sister did not
                                    reply, she just cried. Kuta was tired of asking questions, so he
                                    took the marsupial and went home to cook it. At the house, the
                                    brother told his sister to eat the marsupial, but his sister
                                    just kept crying. So in the early morning, Kuta awoke and
                                    prepared to kill their big <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> for themselves. After he
                                    finished cooking the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          pig </span> in an earth oven, he took it out and divided
                                    it up well. He gave part to his sister who was still crying.
                                    Kuta also divided different kinds of decorations between
                                    themselves. He put his share into a net bag with his share of
                                    pork. He got up and began to walk to a place near Erave where
                                    their maternal relative lived. His sister stood up and spoke to
                                    him, “Please come back. You didn’t tell me when you put the
                                    marsupial near the garden. The marsupial hit my breast and
                                    caused me to cry.” The brother replied, “Yes, I asked you many
                                    times and you didn’t reply. Never mind. You can stay here while
                                    I go to look for my maternal relative.” Kuta left and came to
                                    the village of his relatives. One young man asked him, “Friend,
                                    why have you come here?” Kuta told him, “I came to look for my
                                    maternal relative.” The man said, “OK, come inside and sit in
                                    your maternal relative’s room.” Then a large, old man came and
                                    told Kuta, “I haven’t been looking for tree leaves [i.e., the
                                    branches of the family tree], so what have you come here to do?”
                                    Kuta did not have anything to say, so he kept his mouth shut.
                                    The old man brought a vine and tied him to one of the house
                                    posts. His sister, Paiyali, had followed Kuta. She had come and
                                    hidden in the grass near the house where Kuta was. When Kuta’s
                                    maternal relative arrived, he saw that they had tied up Kuta
                                    with a rope. This angered him, so he told them, “This is my
                                    maternal relative, he isn’t a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> and you have tied him up.” He
                                    untied the vines, then killed two men and ran into the forest.
                                    They tied up Kuta again, then they cut off some of his flesh and
                                    cut out his eyes and began to eat him. Paiyali heard them
                                    cutting Kuta and she began to cry. She thought that it was her
                                    fault. An old woman who had gotten some [of his] blood in a
                                    bamboo tube was returning along the trail where Paiyali was
                                    sitting. She watched her and asked, “Child, what are you doing?”
                                    Paiyali said, “I am Kuta’s sister but they have eaten him.” The
                                    old woman said, “OK, come and we will go to my house.” The old
                                    woman was the mother of Kuta’s maternal relative. She said,
                                    “Child, I am the mother of your maternal relative.” Paiyali
                                    heard this and she was happy. At night the maternal relative
                                    came to the house of the old woman. The old woman told him,
                                    “Child, a maternal relative of yours has followed her brother
                                    here. You must take her back to her village quickly.” The old
                                    woman gave Paiyali the bamboo tube of blood and said, “You must
                                    put this in a cold place, this is the blood of Kuta.” So the
                                    maternal relative took the young woman, and they went to her
                                    village. When Paiyali arrived at her village, she put Kuta’s
                                    blood in a cold place. Then Kuta became a man again. She was
                                    happy and held tightly onto Kuta. The two of them lived in the
                                    village. Later Kuta married a woman who gave birth to his first
                                    child. One day, the wife and sister went to the garden while
                                    Kuta was looking after his child. The two women returned home
                                    quickly, so Kuta was a little angry. When the women came home,
                                    Kuta scolded his wife and sister. His sister told him, “They
                                    nearly ate you, but I carried your blood here. That is why
                                    you’re still alive, so why should you be angry at me?” Kuta
                                    listened to this and turned into the wind. They never saw him
                                    again. The two women were sorry and they became birds. The child
                                    too became a small <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> and tried to find his father in the garden. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, in the time of the ancestors, a brother and sister
                                    lived in a village called Semin [Mendi People, Southern
                                    Highlands Province]. The man’s name was Hil and the woman’s name
                                    was Naowe. One day, Hil told his sister, “I want to look for
                                    some marsupials (kapul) in the forest.” So his sister prepared
                                    some sweet potatoes, put them into a net bag, and gave it to
                                    him. Hil went into the deep forest and saw a big tree. He came
                                    to the foot of this tree and saw a big hole. He put down all of
                                    his things and shoved his hand into the hole. Oh my! A big
                                    marsupial was inside and it bit onto his hand in such a way that
                                    he was unable to pull it out. He was also irritated by the cold
                                    wind, and he was wet. A <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> named Kanmap came by and asked him, “Friend,
                                    what are you doing at the foot of this tree?” Hil said, “Friend,
                                    a marsupial is chewing on my hand and I can’t pull it out.” So
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> went
                                    inside the tree hole, killed the marsupial and pulled it out.
                                    The man was elated and grateful. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> said, “What will you do with
                                    this marsupial?” The man said, “Friend, I came out here to look
                                    for this. If you help me to kill 20 marsupials today, I’ll bring
                                    you to my house and give you good food from the garden.” The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    listened to this and was pleased. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> went with Hil that day. Then
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> told
                                    Hil, “Friend, I don’t like that other food, I only like sweet
                                    potato.” Hil told the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> , “Yes, you will see some. My sister will cook
                                    some delicious sweet potato.” They cooked all of the marsupials
                                    in an earth oven at the house and the roasted the sweet potatoes
                                    in the fire for the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> . The brother and sister ate the marsupials and gave the
                                    sweet potatoes to the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> . The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> ate up all of the sweet potatoes. So now, the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> was a
                                    good friend with Hil and helped him to kill marsupials. Now we
                                    can see the loyal manner of dogs. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, cassowaries often bathed in ponds. Cassowaries would
                                    remove their skirts and enter the pond. Once, a man hid and saw
                                    that they had left their skirts behind. One <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> did
                                    not like this. Later, she saw another <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> that was prettier than
                                    she was. She took the prettier <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> ’s skirt and hid it.
                                    After the cassowaries finished bathing, they went to get their
                                    skirts. As the other cassowaries were putting on their skirts,
                                    the pretty <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> looked for her skirt but could not find it. Later, the
                                    man went up to the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> woman, took her to his village and
                                    married her. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> woman bore two sons that were just like
                                    real boys. When the two children were hungry, they told their
                                    mother, “After you finish cooking the top of the yam, we’ll tell
                                    you where father hid your skirt.” After the children said this,
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    woman felt good. She cooked the top of the yam and gave it to
                                    the two of them. Then they showed her the “grass” skirt that
                                    their father had hidden. The mother <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> put on the skirt and
                                    became just like a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> , as before. Then she put the skirt back
                                    in the same place. Later, the father fought with her. The mother
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    was angry, so she put on her skirt and ran away into the forest,
                                    becoming feral. Another time, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> mother came and took the
                                    children with her. The children went and stayed beneath a tree,
                                    and they fell into a deep sleep. The mother <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    danced, and decorations and many kinds of food appeared. The two
                                    children woke up and asked her, “Where are we?” The mother <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> said,
                                    “If you are hungry, there is a banana here. You can eat the
                                    banana and mark this place.” While the children stayed there,
                                    the mother went down to the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> pond. The mother arrived
                                    and said, “You should make a spear, kill a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> and
                                    we shall eat it.” The mother had tricked the two children. When
                                    they went down to look for their mother, she turned into a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> . The
                                    big brother said, “I know that is mother.” While the two
                                    children slept, the mother told them, “Shoot me. I belong to
                                    you. You must make a fence around me.” So in the morning, the
                                    two children went down to the water and made a fence. After they
                                    finished making the fence, the mother rotted away and many kinds
                                    of food came up from the mother <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> . So, men came and took
                                    these foods. Some of the foods were eaten and others were
                                    planted. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, on Bagabag Island in Madang Province, there were two
                                    clans [Takia People], One clan had good and strong thoughts and
                                    the other had wrong and half-crazy thoughts. They lived near a
                                    bay called Semanur [near Semamur Village], where the sun rises.
                                    The crazy people did not think much about growing food. They
                                    always watched the other clan who had good things and who caught
                                    birds and wild game. Every day, they sat and watched the other
                                    good men with their good things making fishing baskets and
                                    catching many <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> . However, the Ngiringar [Clan] had a different thought.
                                    They thought that the others were not catching <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> correctly.
                                    So they wanted to follow another idea. The other people always
                                    put their fishing baskets in the water with <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> food, and
                                    caught <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> in
                                    this manner. However, they thought that this was not correct.
                                    One morning, an old mother called out to her two children,
                                    “Children, I want us to make a basket. However, we can’t put
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> food
                                    in the basket. We can put food for me in the basket, enough for
                                    two weeks. This is how we will catch many, many <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> .” After
                                    the children listened to their mother, they helped her make a
                                    huge basket. They collected some food, water, firewood and
                                    things needed for sleeping. One morning, they pushed off their
                                    canoe to go asea, they had put the big basket on the canoe and
                                    two big stones too. The mother sat in the canoe and they paddled
                                    towards the deep sea. They paddled and paddled, and found a
                                    place that had many <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          fish </span> . They told their mother this, and she went
                                    inside the basket. The children tied the stones to each side of
                                    the basket, then they slowly lowered the basket with their
                                    mother inside into the sea. They asked her, “Mother, everything
                                    you told us is alright, isn’t it?” Their mother said, “Yes,
                                    everything is alright. However, you can’t come here next week.
                                    Come here after two weeks. I think that this is enough food for
                                    two weeks.” After she said this, the children lowered her down
                                    about six feet below the surface. They lowered her with the
                                    heavy stones on the basket until she reached the sandy bottom.
                                    The children put a marker at the place that they left her. They
                                    paddled back home and waited for their mother. They waited and
                                    waited for one fortnight, then they prepared to get their mother
                                    and return home. They awoke in the morning and shoved their
                                    canoe off into the sea. They paddled and paddled towards their
                                    mother. After about a mile, the sea began to change, but they
                                    were determined. They continued to paddle to the place where the
                                    marker was. Quickly, they pulled their mother with the basket up
                                    towards the surface. They pulled up about six yards of rope and
                                    their hands were very sore. They could see the basket five feet
                                    from the surface, and they could smell their mother [rotting].
                                    They remembered when they had let the basket down before that
                                    they had felt something and had heard a noise. It was their
                                    mother who was drowning and who was pulling the rope to come
                                    back to the surface. However, they had been determined and had
                                    let the basket down quickly. The brothers were very troubled
                                    about their mother. They left her in the sea and returned to the
                                    shore. Now, they were alone in Semanur. </p>

                              <p> Once there were some boys in a small village who played with their
                                    bows and arrows. When they played with their bows and arrows,
                                    one boy wanted to go into the forest to look for <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cuscus </span> (kapul).
                                    [The northern common <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cuscus </span> , Phalanger orientalis, is the only kapul
                                    on Bougainville (Flannery, 1995b: 96-99).] This boy’s name was
                                    Pekabat. Pekabat had called for his friends to go into the
                                    forest. When they arrived at a large fig vine, Pekabat smelled a
                                    “male” banana. This banana was buried underground. A man had put
                                    it there. When the children saw the banana there, they were
                                    elated and ate the banana. After they finished eating it, they
                                    wanted to defecate. They wanted to go into the forest to
                                    defecate. However, one boy spoke, “We must shit in the hole
                                    where the man buried the banana.” After they finished
                                    defecating, they covered their feces well. After they finished,
                                    they climbed the fig vine. They went very high and sat upon one
                                    of the branches. The man who had hidden the banana that the
                                    children had eaten returned to look for his banana. His name was
                                    Tutupiok. Tutupiok came to the place where he had hidden it and
                                    he began to dig the ground. When he touched the feces, he was
                                    not happy. He said, “Aha! My banana has over-ripened, I’ll fill
                                    myself up with it.” However, he smelled the feces and then
                                    smelled his hand. He became irate and spoke again, “Where the
                                    hell are the men who ate my banana? I must find them and then
                                    I’ll have some good food this evening.” After he said this,
                                    Tutupiok looked up the fig tree and saw the children. He said,
                                    “Aha! You’re the ones that ate my banana.” The boys laughed
                                    heartily. This made Tutupiok angry. He then said, “You little
                                    kids are delicious to eat.” He called for them to come down. As
                                    each child descended, Tutupiok shoved the child inside his
                                    mouth. Then Tutupiok went home. When he arrived home, his wife
                                    saw her husband’s belly shaking and rumbling, so she asked him,
                                    “What did you eat?” However, poor Tutupiok did not want to talk.
                                    The children kept running around inside his stomach. Tutupiok
                                    told his wife to heat a big stone in the fire. Tutupiok shoved
                                    the hot stone down his mouth to cook the children that were in
                                    his stomach, but the children ran to another comer of Tutupiok’s
                                    stomach. After the stone had cooled, Tutupiok thought the
                                    children had died but they were not really dead. Tutupiok was
                                    exhausted, so he went to sleep. While he slept, the children
                                    inside his stomach asked, “Who has a small knife?” They found
                                    out that Pekabat had a small pocketknife. Pekabat started to cut
                                    Tutupiok’s stomach. Tutupiok did not feel it when the boys cut
                                    his belly. The children came outside and they killed Tutupiok’s
                                    wife. Tutupiok also died. The children were elated and they
                                    returned home. </p>

                              <p> There was a woman from a small village named Wan [Wanali], near
                                    Sibilanga in the Nuku Patrol Post area [Kayik People, West Sepik
                                    Province]. One day, the woman left her husband at the village
                                    and went to look for her brothers at the village where she was
                                    bom. She was going to look for her brothers because they were
                                    giving a party with dancing and singing. They had sent a message
                                    to this woman to go with her child. If they came, they would get
                                    some pork and other food. The woman left the village, and she
                                    saw her brothers and the other people from her village. They
                                    danced and sang until dawn. They divided the food in the
                                    morning. The woman with her child received their food and poured
                                    it into a limbum container. She shook hands with her parents and
                                    brothers, then returned to Wan Village. They walked back and
                                    came to a village called Yolmbi [Yambil] where a masalai woman
                                    named Mukmak met them. Mukmak said, “Good evening,
                                    granddaughter. Where are you coming from?” The real woman said,
                                    “I went to my village to see my parents and now I’m returning to
                                    Wan Village.” Mukmak replied, “Granddaughter, it’s getting dark
                                    now, let’s sleep. Tomorrow when the sun comes up you can walk
                                    back to Wan and see your husband and other children.” But the
                                    woman said, “Never mind that Mukmak, I’ll hold a torch to see
                                    the trail because it would be bad if the other men’s children
                                    beat up my little children at Wan.” The woman told this to
                                    Mukmak because she knew that Mukmak was a cannibal. She wanted
                                    to run away quickly and she departed. She had not gone far when
                                    Mukmak turned her finger, then the woman turned around and went
                                    back to Mukmak’s village. Mukmak sat and watched the woman and
                                    child return. She said, “Oh granddaughter, you’ve returned,
                                    huh?” The woman replied, “Grandma, I didn’t leave, but I don’t
                                    know why I’ve returned.” Mukmak said, “Granddaughter, never
                                    mind. We can sleep now. Tomorrow when the sun is out, you can
                                    go.” So the two of them slept and in the evening Mukmak climbed
                                    a coconut palm tree. The real woman and her child were below on
                                    the ground holding leafy vegetables. They were cutting and
                                    counting the coconuts as they fell. When the masalai Mukmak came
                                    down again from the tree, the woman and child were working at
                                    gathering and counting the coconuts. The real woman said that
                                    she wanted to go to a place on a mountain. The masalai woman
                                    spoke, “OK, you can go.” The woman went to find coconuts and she
                                    met Mukmak’s masalai husband. The masalai man said, “Why did you
                                    come and sleep with that bad masalai woman? She has killed many
                                    people and eaten them raw. You should not go to sleep tonight.
                                    You should try to trick Mukmak and return to Wan Village with
                                    your child.” After she heard this, the woman was terrified, her
                                    heart sunk, and she trembled with fear. She took the coconuts
                                    and went back to sleep with Mukmak, the masalai woman. They went
                                    inside Mukmak’s house, built a fire and put the limbum mat for
                                    the real woman to sleep with her child. Mukmak slept on a rack
                                    used for smoking meat. Mukmak went out to urinate. When she
                                    returned she wanted to close the door, but the real woman said,
                                    “Grandma, leave the door open, I’ll shut it.” So Mukmak went on
                                    top of her rack to sleep. In the dead of night, the woman went
                                    out to urinate. Later she went inside to see that Mukmak had
                                    given her breast to her child and was sleeping on the rack.
                                    Mukmak looked at her child and it was like a flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> on the real
                                    woman’s mat. The woman saw this, took back her child and
                                    pretended to sleep to get Mukmak to go back to sleep. When the
                                    real woman heard Mukmak snoring, she took her child and a small
                                    torch that she covered with a leaf. They ran back to Wan that
                                    night. Mukmak took her spear and threw it where the woman had
                                    been sleeping, but the woman was not there. Mukmak was irate and
                                    said, “Hey, are you taking advantage of my mercy for you? If so,
                                    I’ll still kill and eat you tomorrow.” Mukmak’s anger built up.
                                    She slept until dawn, then made a long thread and tied one end
                                    to a tanget plant in Yolmbi Village. She held the other end and
                                    went to Wan Village to find the woman and child who had run away
                                    in the night. After she tied the thread to the tanget, she spoke
                                    to her husband, “Stay here and keep your eye on this thread and
                                    tanget. If you see that the thread isn’t taut and that the
                                    tanget is dead as if it were smoked from a fire then, you’ll
                                    know that they’ve killed me. If you see that the tanget isn’t
                                    dead and that the thread is still taut, then you’ll know that
                                    I’m still alright.” Mukmak walked away. She called out and blew
                                    a conch trumpet to ask for the woman and child. She sang, “Oh
                                    granddaughter, why did you get up and walk away last night? You
                                    did not like sleeping till the morning. OK, you and I can go to
                                    Wan Village.” She came to Sibilanga Village and hid her trumpet
                                    [Aruop People]. The men of Wan Village were ready with their
                                    bows, arrows and other fighting implements. They tried to trick
                                    her with some kinds of food, but Mukmak knew about this and
                                    said, “I have all of these kinds of foods at home.” She did not
                                    eat the food that the men of Wan had put out, but she was
                                    thirsty and asked them to give her some young coconut milk.
                                    While she was drinking, the men said, “We always drink with our
                                    head, eyes and neck facing the sky. You must drink like this
                                    too.” When she faced skyward, the men cut her neck with a shield
                                    made of sago palm wood and she died. Then they buried her. Her
                                    husband saw the string slacken and the tanget dry up as if it
                                    had been smoked by fire. He knew that they had killed his wife.

                              <p> Once there were two brothers. Their parents had died and they
                                    lived alone. The big brother was married. He and his wife worked
                                    in their garden planting food. However, the little brother sat
                                    alone in the house making bows and arrows. He never helped in
                                    the garden. They went on like this and then the big brother
                                    spoke angrily with his wife in secret about the little brother.
                                    They said, “He never helps us work in the garden. He always just
                                    sits alone in the house eating our food. What should we do with
                                    him?” Then the big brother spoke to his wife, “Tomorrow morning,
                                    we should go to the garden. He won’t follow us. Then at night
                                    I’ll cut his neck as he sleeps.” After they finished talking,
                                    the ghost of the brothers’ father heard this. He quickly turned
                                    into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> and
                                    flew into the house where the little brother lived. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> told him,
                                    “You must get up in the night when the moon has risen. Gather
                                    all your things and run away to that ridge.” The little brother
                                    was surprised and said, “Why should I go to that ridge?” The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span>
                                    said, “Because your big brother and his wife are angry at you.
                                    Your big brother said that at night when you are sleeping he
                                    will cut your neck.” That evening, the big brother with his wife
                                    went to the garden. They cooked some food, ate it and went to
                                    sleep. But the little brother only pretended to sleep. He moved
                                    as if asleep. When the moon rose, he saw the light and left. He
                                    went slowly to the place where his big brother’s wife was. He
                                    carried her slowly and put her where he always slept. After he
                                    put her there, he went outside and ran away to the ridge. Later
                                    that night, the big brother woke up, took his axe and slowly
                                    went to the place where his little brother always slept. He saw
                                    his wife but he thought it was his little brother, so he cut her
                                    neck. In the morning, the big brother woke up and looked there.
                                    No! He was irate. He took his bow and followed the trail of his
                                    little brother. However, his little brother already knew that
                                    his big brother would follow him, so he hid along the trail.
                                    When the big brother came near, he shot him in the liver with a
                                    spear. So, the little brother went back home and later was
                                    happily married. </p>

                              <p> Black Cockatoo [palm <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cockatoo </span> (Beehler et al., 1986: 117)] told his
                                    young wife, “OK, we are married now. It would be better if you
                                    cooked my food.” However, the young woman did not understand the
                                    words, “to cook food.” So, she went to get some taros, yams and
                                    bananas, and washed them in the river. Then she removed their
                                    skins. She carried this food back to Black Cockatoo. The young
                                    woman spoke, “I have prepared some good food for you, sit and
                                    eat.” Cockatoo saw the food, held a piece of taro in his hand
                                    and said, “Hey! This taro is still hard and it’s not hot. It’s
                                    true that you removed the skin well, and all of the food is
                                    clean. But I don’t like to eat cold food. It would be better if
                                    you cooked this food again.” So, the young woman took the food
                                    back and carried it away. However, she did not understand what
                                    her husband had said. So she thought and thought, “What is
                                    ‘cooking food?”’ She felt the taro in her hand and she
                                    understood, “It was true that the food was cold. I think that my
                                    husband likes hot food.” So, the woman carried the food under
                                    the sun and put the taro and yam and banana on top of a stone.
                                    The food was under the sun long enough to heat it. Later the
                                    young woman carried the food back to Black Cockatoo. She said,
                                    “Now your food is hot. Now you can eat it.” Cockatoo held a yam
                                    in his hand and felt that the yam was still hard. “What have you
                                    done? I told you that you must cook this food of mine.” Black
                                    Cockatoo was angry now and said, “Where is the fire?” The young
                                    woman replied, “What is fire?” In the young woman’s village, the
                                    people did not know about fire and they did not know how to cook
                                    food. They just ate everything. If they wanted to heat
                                    something, they just put it under the sun. Now the Black
                                    Cockatoo understood. He thought, “It would be better if I taught
                                    my wife the way to make a fire.” Cockatoo told the woman, “Go
                                    and find some tree branches that are very dry and carry them
                                    here.” He taught her how to make fire and to cook food. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was a man and woman who had two children. The man
                                    only ate ginger roots from the forest. The woman and her two
                                    children only ate taro. The woman always hid the taro underneath
                                    firewood. When the man was not there, she would cook and eat it
                                    with her children. This is how it went every day. One day, the
                                    woman went to the garden with her eldest daughter. They went to
                                    find firewood and food from the garden. The husband watched
                                    after the younger child at home. Near noontime, the child cried
                                    with hunger. So, the father cooked some wild ginger roots and
                                    gave them to the child. However, the child did not like them and
                                    continued to cry. The father thought, “Why isn’t the child
                                    eating this food?” While the child cried, it pointed its finger
                                    to where the mother hid the taro. Then the father thought, “Why
                                    is the child pointing to that place?” He did not know that his
                                    wife hid taro underneath the firewood. The father went and
                                    pulled up the firewood, then saw the taro there. He said, “Hey!
                                    You were always eating this good food, and I was like a fool.
                                    You only gave me wild things to eat.” Then he took two pieces of
                                    taro and cooked them in the fire. After the taro was done, he
                                    gave one to the child. He smelled the other and vomited the
                                    ginger he had eaten as if it were garbage. After he had finished
                                    vomiting, he ate the taro. In the afternoon, his wife and eldest
                                    child returned. The woman was famished and wanted to cook her
                                    taros, so she removed the firewood, but she did not find any
                                    taros. The woman did not say anything. She went out, took some
                                    bamboo skin [bamboo fishing gear?] and tried to catch some <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . Then she
                                    tried to swim in the water. She looked hard for <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . She left
                                    her bag and hid the bamboo skin. She returned home and asked her
                                    husband, “Who took my taro?” The man spoke, “I was always like a
                                    fool and you always gave me wild things from the forest, while
                                    you and the children ate good taro, huh?” The woman spoke,
                                    “That’s OK. Now you can look after the two children.” She milked
                                    her breasts into a bamboo tube and gave it to her daughter. She
                                    said, “Take this and when your brother cries, give it to him.
                                    When the milk is done, bring your brother to the Ungu Pond and
                                    sing to him, ‘Avo mao na mi pamo.’” Then the woman took the
                                    bamboo skin. She turned into a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> and swam in Ungu Pond. The
                                    girl looked after her brother until the milk was finished, then
                                    she brought him to Ungu Pond and sung to him as her mother had
                                    told her. The mother came and gave him some milk. This is how it
                                    went for a long time. Then one time the father hid near the Ungu
                                    Pond. He saw that his wife was giving milk to the child. After
                                    he saw this, he went back home. He sent a message to all of the
                                    other villages, the message was for the men to gather and bring
                                    back his wife. One day, the men came together, they built a
                                    fence around the Ungu Pond. When it was time for her to give
                                    milk to the child, the men quickly held her tightly. However,
                                    she quickly turned into a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> again and jumped back into the
                                    water, never to return again. So, in my village, women worry
                                    about taro. They always leave it alone because they are afraid
                                    of turning into <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> . </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was an old woman who slept inside a house
                                    near a big village. She kept her door shut all of the time. One
                                    day, the little boys heard a noise inside this old woman’s
                                    house. One boy asked, “What’s that?” Another boy said, “I don’t
                                    know.” Others said, “Let’s ask the old woman.” However, the old
                                    woman was not inside the house, so the boys searched for her
                                    everywhere. Later, they saw her working in a garden. She asked
                                    the boys, “What do you want?” They said, “We heard a noise
                                    inside your house. Is there a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> inside your house?” The old
                                    woman said, “There’s no <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          bird </span> inside my house.” They asked, “Is there a man
                                    inside your house?” The woman said, “No, there’s no man inside
                                    my house.” Then she said angrily, “Go away!” So, the boys went
                                    back to their village. They said, “One day we’ll find out what’s
                                    inside the old woman’s house.” Three weeks passed, and some men
                                    stole bananas from the old woman’s garden. She became angry, so
                                    she went to the village and asked the men about her bananas. She
                                    said, “Who stole my bananas?” The men did not know. “Please help
                                    me to find my bananas,” she said. The men laughed. They said,
                                    “We don’t know anything about your bananas.” The old woman
                                    became irate and said, “I’ll imprison you. I’ll open the door of
                                    my house.” The boys said, “She can’t imprison us.” The boys
                                    decided to go inside the old woman’s house and look. “Let’s find
                                    out what is inside the old woman’s house,” they said. So, they
                                    followed the old woman and quickly went to her house, then
                                    opened the door. At this time, mosquitoes came outside the
                                    house. The boys had never seen mosquitoes before. “What’s that?”
                                    they asked. Later they found out that mosquitoes were like awful
                                    maternal relatives. They flew behind the boys and bit them. The
                                    boys quickly ran back to the village, but the mosquitoes flew
                                    after them. The elders saw the mosquitoes chasing the boys and
                                    then the mosquitoes started biting the men and women too. The
                                    men and women were very concerned about the bananas and said,
                                    “We don’t want to help the old woman find her bananas now that
                                    she unleashed these mosquitoes from her house. She was a very
                                    good old woman. She had put the mosquitoes far from us, but we
                                    didn’t help her.” Now, for many years and months when it is the
                                    rainy season, the mosquitoes always bite men, women and children
                                    all over the place. </p>

                              <p> One day, the women of Lonem [Loneim Village, Mountain Arapesh
                                    People, East Sepik Province] went to their gardens and pulled
                                    out taro corms. After they removed the taros, the corms were
                                    covered with dirt so they went to the river to wash them off.
                                    While the women washed the taros, their children worked fishing
                                    in the river. The little <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > fish </span> went near a particular pond, but people
                                    never went near this pond because a masalai dwelled there. A
                                    mudfish [?] had died there, but it was not a true mudfish, it
                                    was one of their men. His spirit had died and the small spirits
                                    had carried him up to this pond. However, the children did not
                                    know this and thought it was a real <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> . They took this dead <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> and gave
                                    it to their mothers. When the mothers had finished washing the
                                    taros, they took the dead <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> with the taros and went to the
                                    village. They cooked the dead <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> and when they cut it to eat,
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> was
                                    full of blood. The blood was just like that of a man, so they
                                    cooked it again in the fire but the blood did not dry up. They
                                    removed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> from the fire again and ate it with the blood. After
                                    they finished eating, they went inside their houses and slept.
                                    That night, the rain came down. A strong wind blew and there was
                                    thunder. They did not know why the weather was like this. Late
                                    that night, the water from the pond rose and flooded their
                                    village. The water went so high that it killed all of the
                                    people, dogs and pigs. The water went inside their houses, then
                                    it went above their houses and covered everything in the
                                    village. Only two people were able to escape, a man with a woman
                                    who went up high. In the morning, they came down, went on top of
                                    a mountain and thought. Now they call this village Lonem.
                                    Before, the people of Lonem lived in Malan [Malin] near Jlipain
                                    [Japuain] Village. One can stand in Jlipain and look at Malan.
                                    The land that the people of Jlipain use for gardens actually
                                    belongs to the people of Lonem. So if you think that I am lying
                                    to you, go find a man or woman from Lonem or Jlipain. They can
                                    also tell you this story. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there were two sisters who lived in a village. The big
                                    sister was married and had a child. One afternoon, the big
                                    sister told the little sister, “Go home and cook some food. When
                                    it’s dark, go down and wait for me near the village, then I’ll
                                    come with the child. You can carry him while I spearfish in the
                                    river.” The little sister listened to this and went to cook the
                                    food. Night came quickly, and a ghost woman was waiting where
                                    the big sister had told the little sister to wait. When the big
                                    sister with her little baby went to the meeting place, they
                                    found this ghost. She thought that it was her sister because the
                                    ghost looked like her. Because she did not know that it was a
                                    ghost, she spoke to her. The two of them with the little baby in
                                    a net bag walked along. When they arrived at the river, the big
                                    sister gave the baby to the ghost and said to her, “If the baby
                                    cries, you must give the baby to me. I’ll give the baby milk and
                                    then I’ll return the baby to you.” The big sister also gave her
                                    a bamboo tube to put <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          fish </span> in, saying, “When I spear <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> , I’ll
                                    give them to you. You should put them in the tube.” After she
                                    said this, she began to spear the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> and give them to the ghost
                                    woman to put in the tube. However, the ghost just took and ate
                                    them. When they went a little farther upriver, the ghost woman
                                    put her hand inside the baby’s net bag. She pulled and broke off
                                    one of the baby’s legs, eating it quickly. The baby cried and
                                    its mother said, “Come, I’ll give you milk and you’ll sleep.”
                                    However, the ghost said, “I’ll make the baby sleep,” and the
                                    baby did sleep. After the baby slept, the ghost broke and pulled
                                    off the other leg and ate it quickly. The baby cried again and
                                    the mother said she would give it milk. However, the ghost said,
                                    “I’ll make the baby sleep now.” The ghost did this to the entire
                                    baby’s body and put an old, short piece of wood inside the net
                                    bag with the baby’s loincloth. The ghost had eaten the big <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> that the
                                    sister had speared, so the ghost just held the empty tube. They
                                    spearfished in the river until the morning. Then the big sister
                                    approached and said to the ghost woman, “Give me my baby and
                                    I’ll give it milk. The baby did not have any all night.” The
                                    ghost gave the net bag to the big sister. She looked inside the
                                    net bag and saw the piece of wood. She asked the ghost woman,
                                    “Where is my baby? This is a piece of wood inside the net bag!”
                                    The ghost woman heard this and fled. The woman saw this and ran
                                    after her. The woman chased the ghost who went inside a big
                                    boulder. Then the woman left her and went to the village, where
                                    she told all of the men and woman. They took their knives, axes
                                    and spears, and went into the forest. They arrived at the
                                    boulder where the ghost had entered. The woman told the people
                                    that this was where the ghosts entered. The woman spoke to them,
                                    “If we dig and the ghosts come out and they want to flee, you
                                    must kill one and cut her up. As they come out, you’ll see one
                                    whose skin is entirely red. When you see this redskinned one,
                                    you can kill her, you should let any others go.” They listened
                                    to this and then began to dig around the boulder. While they
                                    dug, they found ghosts. The ghosts began to flee, so the men and
                                    women watched. They saw the final one, the one who was red. They
                                    killed her and cut her into tiny pieces. Afterwards in the
                                    village, the men tabooed the women from spearfishing in the
                                    river at night. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was an old woman, a boy and a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> who lived
                                    near a mountain. The woman’s husband had died and she did not
                                    have a husband. The boy’s parents had also died. The two of them
                                    lived in the same house and worked together. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> had come to
                                    their house. They gave food to him and took care of it well.
                                    They always did good things for each other and worked together
                                    every day. When they made a new garden or did other tasks, they
                                    began in the early morning and returned to their house in the
                                    evening. The place where they lived was deep in the forest.
                                    There was no good place to plant real food because there were
                                    many stones and large trees. If you walked through this area you
                                    would become completely lost. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> was very clever, it always
                                    walked well along the trails. One time, they went to their
                                    garden to harvest taro. They worked at pulling out taro corms
                                    starting in the early morning. At about two o’clock in the
                                    afternoon, it began to rain. They gathered all of the taros and
                                    went someplace to sit down, but they could not find a hut to sit
                                    in. As it began to pour, they hid underneath a boulder that was
                                    near the garden. It was almost as dark as night. They said, “How
                                    will we get to the house?” They continued to talk. They thought,
                                    “We left our house and came here, but who will husband the pigs
                                    at home?” Then it became pitch black and they could not see a
                                    thing. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    spoke like a man and said, “I see the house and the pigs. We
                                    should go to the house now.” “How will we get there?” they said.
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    replied, “Old woman, hold my tail and tell the boy to hold your
                                    hand.” Then the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> said, “Let’s go.” They listened to the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> and were
                                    terrified. Then they heard a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> squealing. Oh my, they arrived
                                    at their house! This place is near Kumdi in the Western
                                    Highlands Province [Hagen People]. So now, we take care of dogs
                                    well. When we lose a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">

                                          type="animal"> dog </span> can smell the trail and find it
                                    quickly. </p>

                              <p> There was a man who was married to two women. One wife had black
                                    skin and the other had red skin. One time, the red woman
                                    disliked her husband and fled to her parents’ village. Her
                                    husband wanted to get her and bring her back to his village, so
                                    he took some things for purchasing women, such as pigs, kina
                                    shells, and rock salt. [The husband apparently kills her
                                    instead.] The [red] woman’s ghost went to a small pond. This
                                    pond was where the women went to hunt for frogs. The first
                                    [black] woman did not know that her husband had killed the
                                    second woman. No, she did not know this. At this time, the woman
                                    wanted to hunt for frogs in the little pond where the ghost of
                                    the second woman was staying. She prepared a torch and went late
                                    at night. When she arrived there, she caught many frogs. While
                                    she was still there, something came and extinguished her torch.
                                    It was just the red woman’s ghost, whom the man had killed. The
                                    ghost spoke, “Carry me to your house.” So, the woman who was
                                    hunting frogs carried the ghost to the woman’s village. She
                                    carried her and carried her, and she became very short of breath
                                    almost collapsing. The ghost said, “Sit and open the door.”
                                    However, the woman who was carrying the ghost said, “Sit and
                                    make a fire.” The ghost said, “No, carry me on your shoulders
                                    and make the fire.” After the ghost said this, the real woman
                                    became irate. The real woman put the ghost on top of her
                                    shoulders and made a huge fire. The woman made the fire inside
                                    her house and burned the ghost on the fire that she had made.
                                    The ghost said, “Oh I’m sorry sister, this is not a fight.” The
                                    ghost then got up and fought the real woman. However, the real
                                    woman was not gentle and she fought back. They fought and fought
                                    until they were both short of breath and they just died. Their
                                    mouths were wide open as the lay near the house door. One was
                                    dead on each side of the door. The husband of the real woman
                                    thought of bringing some <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > pig </span> fodder to the woman’s house. He went there,
                                    but there was no smoke at the woman’s house, so he thought that
                                    the woman had gone to find <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> fodder in the garden. He
                                    thought this then he opened the door of the house. The pigs
                                    inside were squealing, but the man did not know about the two
                                    dead women inside the door with their open mouths. He opened the
                                    door and put his two hands into the mouths of the two dead
                                    women, then he died too. It was the fault of the ghost that the
                                    man and woman had died. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, men worked with stone axes. Once there was a man who was
                                    sharpening his stone axe. A <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> frog </span> croaked near where he was
                                    working. He heard this once, then twice, then he got up to find
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> frog </span> . He
                                    searched and searched, but he could not find it. So, he sat down
                                    and worked at sharpening his axe again. While he was sharpening
                                    his axe, he heard it again. Then he sat and sharpened it softly.
                                    He heard the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> frog
                                    </span> croaking down in his testicles. He got up and cut off
                                    his testicles, then a little <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> frog </span> jumped to the ground. He took
                                    the little <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> frog </span>
                                    and put it on top of a tree leaf, then he went home. After a
                                    week, he returned to see the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> frog </span> . The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> frog </span> had turned
                                    into a small girl who lived where he had put the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> frog </span> . The man
                                    saw the girl and asked her, “How did you come here?” The girl
                                    told him, “No. I just came from your balls, then you put me
                                    here. I stayed here and turned into a little girl.” The man
                                    listened to this, then built a house and placed her inside it.
                                    While she lived there, the man took care of her very well. After
                                    the girl became big, he took her to the village and put her in
                                    the spirit house. While she lived in the spirit house, she made
                                    attractive net bags for the men of the village. All of the men
                                    of the village carried these attractive net bags. The men’s
                                    wives asked each of their husbands about the bags. They said,
                                    “We don’t know who really made the men’s beautiful net bags that
                                    they carry, nor why they are always happy about these beautiful
                                    net bags.” One time in the early morning, all of the men woke up
                                    and went into the forest. Only the women were left in the
                                    village. One woman climbed a coconut palm tree and threw
                                    coconuts to the ground. Some fell to the ground in other places,
                                    and one fell and rolled inside the spirit house. The woman came
                                    down and fetched the coconuts, then looked for the one that went
                                    inside the spirit house. She searched and went inside the spirit
                                    house. She looked inside and saw a woman sitting there. She told
                                    all of the women, “I saw a woman sitting in the spirit house.”
                                    The women told her, “She’s probably the woman who made our
                                    husbands’ net bags.” They said, “We should bum this house.” So,
                                    they lit a fire at the spirit house and the entire house burned.
                                    At this time, the men returned. The poor men saw this and were
                                    very worried that the woman inside was burned to a crisp. They
                                    took the ashes from the fire that had burned the woman, and they
                                    put them inside a bundle made of limbum palm leaves. Quickly,
                                    they made a new spirit house and they put the ashes in the new
                                    spirit house. That night, all of the men, women and children
                                    went inside to sing and dance. They sang and danced until it was
                                    nearly dawn. Then all of the men, women and children turned into
                                    flying foxes and departed. One girl who was not yet big was
                                    carried away by a she- <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          frog </span> . Later, the girl cried and cried. A <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cockatoo </span> found
                                    her and took her to sleep near the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cockatoo </span> ’s nest. So, every time
                                    you look at her, she [i.e., a flying <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> ] is flying near dusk. </p>

                              <p> In a village called Lenke, near Wabag [Enga Province, Enga
                                    People], there lived two young women who were sisters. They
                                    obtained their food from their own hard work. One nice afternoon
                                    when the sun was setting, they made some mounds for planting
                                    sweet potatoes outside their house. The sisters were working in
                                    their garden when a big <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          eagle </span> came down and searched for the insects near
                                    where they were working. The younger sister took the stick that
                                    she was using to make the mounds. She walked on her hands and
                                    knees close to the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> . She approached and broke one of the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> eagle </span> ’s wings.
                                    The poor <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> eagle </span>
                                    could no longer <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fly
                                    </span> well because the young woman had broken part of its
                                    wing. It jumped up poorly, flew over four of the sweet potato
                                    mounds and landed. The two sisters ran to grab the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> . They
                                    approached the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> eagle
                                    </span> , jumped and fell in the garden. Then they ran again to
                                    get the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> .
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> jumped
                                    and fell in the nearby scrub forest, leaving the sisters’ garden
                                    and house. The chase continued and the sisters went far from
                                    their home. The elder sister told the younger sister, “Never
                                    mind. We have come far and it will be dark soon. Let’s go back
                                    to the house.” The younger sister said, “No, you go home. I want
                                    to follow this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> and kill it. After I get it I’ll go home.” The elder
                                    sister went back. The younger sister thought she could capture
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> , so
                                    she continued to run after it. It was dark now and the young
                                    woman could not see the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          eagle </span> well that she had been following. At this
                                    point, she met a man in a village called Wanepap in the Laigam
                                    [Laiagam] area. The man asked her, “What are you looking for in
                                    the darkness?” The woman replied, “Hey, good man, I’m not from
                                    around here. I’m following a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> that I struck in my garden..
                                    I’m chasing it and now I don’t know where it is. Now I’m also
                                    confused as to which trail I came from.” “Never mind, it’s too
                                    dark now,” the man told her, “Come with me and sleep in my
                                    house. You can leave tomorrow.” So the young woman went with
                                    this man to his house. The next day, the man woke up in the
                                    early morning and cooked three sweet potatoes. When the sweet
                                    potatoes were done, he gave one to the woman and kept one for
                                    himself. The woman watched carefully what the man did with the
                                    other sweet potato. He took the third sweet potato and threw it
                                    outside. Right away, the woman heard thunder and she looked
                                    outside. She saw an <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          eagle </span> , the same kind that she had hit, come to
                                    eat the sweet potato. The woman thought hard. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> outside
                                    was not just another <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          bird </span> , it was the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> that she had been following.
                                    She was happy and told the man, “That’s my <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> . I
                                    followed it here. I had broken a piece of its wing.” The man
                                    replied, “There are many birds like that. You can’t think that
                                    it is your <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span>
                                    . That is my <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> . I don’t think it went far.” The woman spoke more
                                    emphatically that the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          eagle </span> belonged to her. She looked at her <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> and was
                                    very happy. She forgot about returning to her village. The woman
                                    went to the man’s garden, where she weeded and made a new
                                    garden. She stayed with the man for a month, later they married
                                    and had children. The first of their children were named Sambe
                                    [Sambe], Kunalin [Kunalfni] and Kandep [Kandepe (Lang, 1973:
                                    214-215)]. If you, the reader, come to the Ambun Valley of Enga
                                    Province or the Sau [Sau (Lang, 1973: 215)] Valley near Laiagam,
                                    you can see the Kunalin Clan. The other clans are named as if

                              <p> There was a man named Raringi. This man heard some men say that
                                    the bones of his father were in another clan’s area. He thought
                                    about going to talk to them to get them back. Raringi went to
                                    try to talk with this clan. However, they said, “We know nothing
                                    about this.” So he went to another clan, and they said, “We know
                                    nothing about the bones.” He went to yet another clan and asked
                                    about the bones. They too said, “No.” He went to another clan
                                    and asked, “Do you have the bones of the father of Kampani
                                    Raringi or not?” They said, “There isn’t a single bone here. Go
                                    to the Ramui Clan and ask them. There are three bones at that
                                    place. We’ve just heard this as a rumor.” So, Raringi went to
                                    talk with this Ramui Clan. He talked about his father’s bones.
                                    They asked Raringi, “What kind of man was he? Was he tall or
                                    short?” Raringi said, “My father was a very tall man, but I was
                                    still small when he died. I never saw him with my own eyes, but
                                    some of my clansmen said that he was a very tall man. So, I’m
                                    searching for his long bones.” They said, “Look at this bone, it
                                    is very long.” Raringi said, “This is my father’s bone. I want
                                    to take it with me.” The men gave him his father bones. He took
                                    them back to his home. Raringi’s family and the rest of his clan
                                    were happy that he had found his father’s bones. The next day,
                                    Kampani Raringi gathered together his clan and said, “Now listen
                                    just to what I say. Do as I say, because I have found my
                                    father’s bones.” So, they followed only the instructions of
                                    Kampani Raringi. Raringi said to make a big party with only pork
                                    to eat. They followed his instructions and made a big party with
                                    pork. He said, “Now is the time for a big one-week gathering.”
                                    So, they followed him. He told them to go to all of the places
                                    to find salt, and they did this. Then he told them to find <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> feathers
                                    in the forest. They followed his instructions and found them.
                                    Then he said to eat and to play games at night, and they
                                    followed him. He told them to hold each other’s hands and circle
                                    the house eight times. They did this as he stood in the middle
                                    of them. Then he said, “Now, all of you come and sleep in my big
                                    house and tell stories.” So they followed him. Then he said,
                                    “Now you can make a big festival ground, a place to line up and
                                    display kina shells and pigs.” They followed his instructions.
                                    Then he told only the leaders to come to his house and take the
                                    skull. They followed his instructions and came. Then he said,
                                    “Now, go and fight with the enemy clan.” They followed his
                                    instructions and departed. Then he said, “Make a big canal
                                    running up to a big river so that the water will come near my
                                    house.” They followed his instructions and made the canal,
                                    connecting it to a big river, making the water run close to his
                                    house. Then Raringi called this canal Nukumbukun. meaning “My
                                    clan.” Kampani Raringi had only one son. His name was Anda,
                                    meaning “I am old and suffering.” Kampani Raringi became old.
                                    When he was near death, he gave his blessings to [his son]. He
                                    said, “You can take my place and work and follow my orders. The
                                    others can follow your orders.” He continued speaking, “When I
                                    die, bury me with my father’s bones in a grave. On top of the
                                    grave, plant an ironwood tree. This is a strong tree. The base
                                    of the tree shall mark me as a strong man.” Anda followed his
                                    father’s instructions and did this. Anda took his father’s place
                                    and spoke to his clan. He spoke to them, giving them laws to
                                    follow. Some of the things he said were: “All food must be
                                    cooked in an earth oven with [hot] stones. It is forbidden to
                                    cook directly in a fire. Only pigs must be cooked in a fire. It
                                    is forbidden to cook them in an earth oven.” Then he said, “When
                                    you give birth to a boy, take him to me. I must give him his
                                    name. Girls must also be brought to me to be named. It is
                                    forbidden for you to give names to your children.” Then he spoke
                                    about his origin, “My mother gave birth to me on a bed in my
                                    father’s big house. I lived on my mother’s milk and grew bigger.
                                    My mother gave me ripe bananas. I ate these and became big. Then
                                    she gave me many vegetables and I ate these. These are the foods
                                    that my mother gave me: birds’ eggs, red yams, taros, cucumbers,
                                    beans, pieces of pork, and red sweet potatoes. I ate these and I
                                    became as big as a man. I married one of my father’s kin. Now I
                                    have taken the place of my father and I shall do his work.”
                                    After this he told the clan, “Go and count every tree that is
                                    standing near here.” They went, but they could not finish
                                    counting the trees. So, he sent them to the river to count all
                                    of the stones in the river. However, they could not finish
                                    counting the number of stones either. He told them to count the
                                    number of birds in the forest, but they could not finish
                                    counting the birds. Then he sent them to count the snakes, but
                                    they could not finish counting the number of snakes. He told
                                    them, “All of you come and make a big house for me. This house
                                    must have seven doors. After that you can cut seven big trees
                                    and make seven posts to stand near the seven doors of my house.”
                                    They followed Anda’s instructions and did this. Anda took the
                                    place of his father, Raringi, and instructed his clan until he
                                    became an old man and he died. He did not have a son. So his
                                    three daughters took him and buried him near his father’s grave.
                                    They instructed the clan about this, then enemies came and
                                    ruined the village. Now there are no more people there. Nothing
                                    is there at all. </p>

                              <p> One day, a mother gave birth to twin boys. The two boys lived with
                                    their parents for three years. Then the parents died. The two
                                    boys grew up and became tall and stout. One day, the two
                                    brothers were hungry for meat. So they went to the forest to
                                    find wild game. Inside the forest, Mai [one of the brothers] saw
                                    two trees like themselves. The trees were tall and fat and
                                    looked just like them. So Mai said to Ku [the other brother],
                                    “Look at those two trees that look like us. Let’s try killing
                                    these trees. Ku! You remove the bark of one tree and I’ll remove
                                    the bark of the other tree. Tomorrow we’ll come back here and
                                    see which tree is dead. The tree that is dead will mean which
                                    one of us will die first.” So the two boys removed the bark of
                                    the two trees and then returned to their house to sleep. The
                                    next day in the early morning, they awoke and left for the
                                    forest. They looked at the trees from the previous day. They
                                    looked for a long time and saw that Ku’s tree had died. Ku’s
                                    dead tree grew in a clearing. They were both sad now. Ku thought
                                    and thought about his death. He thought, “When will I die?” Mai
                                    was very sorry that his brother would die. He said, “Whom will I
                                    live with afterwards?” Mai cooked much pork and gave it to Ku to
                                    eat. After three days, Ku was dead. Mai cried and cried and
                                    buried him near the house. Four months later, Mai wanted to look
                                    and see whether his tree was dead, so he went into the forest.
                                    His tree was still alive. Ku’s tree was completely dried out and
                                    it was full of insects that were eating it [probably <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> beetle </span> grubs].
                                    Mai cut the tree to get out the insects and eat them. In back of
                                    Mai there was a noise, so he turned and saw Ku’s ghost coming.
                                    Mai was afraid and trembled with fear. Ku said, “Brother Mai,
                                    don’t be afraid. I came for us to cut the tree until the sun
                                    sets.” Mai was still afraid as Mai spoke, and a house appeared
                                    where they were. They slept in the house, but Mai was still
                                    afraid that Ku’s ghost would do something bad and eat him in the
                                    night. Ku woke up and asked Mai, “Why are you afraid? Now is the
                                    time to sleep.” Mai wanted to trick him by saying, “I’m thirsty
                                    for water.” Ku said, “Good, I’ll go and get some water for you
                                    to drink. But don’t touch my net bag, I’ll put it here before I
                                    go.” Ku left and Mai took the net bag and saw two pennies
                                    inside. He just looked at them and then left them where he found
                                    them. Ku returned with a bottle of water. Mai drank the entire
                                    bottle. Then Ku said, “Brother, I saw that you held my net bag.”
                                    Mai said, “Yes I took it, but I only looked. I didn’t take
                                    anything from your net bag.” Ku did not say anything more. They
                                    both slept again. As Mai slept, Ku quickly took the two pennies
                                    and put them on Mai’s liver and left. Mai slept for three weeks.
                                    Ku returned again and removed the two pennies from Mai and Mai
                                    said, “Man! I slept really well.” Ku greeted his brother Mai and
                                    said, “You ignored what I said and you slept for three weeks.
                                    Now go home.” Mai did not say anything, he returned to his
                                    house. </p>

                              <p> Once there were a man and his wife who were picking breadfruit in
                                    the deep forest. The man told his wife, “Climb that tree.” The
                                    woman told her husband, “You climb it.” So, the man climbed high
                                    up the tree. He went to the crown and showed her how to pick
                                    breadfruit. The woman stood on the ground and saw a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    approaching, so she followed it deeper into the forest, arriving
                                    at a pond. She took a stick and struck the water, which splashed
                                    about, then she went to the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> ’s home. The man had
                                    finished getting breadfruits, so he told his wife to collect the
                                    breadfruits and put them in a pile. The woman did not reply, so
                                    he came down and saw that a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> had gone into the forest
                                    with his wife. He followed their trail and arrived at the pond.
                                    He took the stick that they had used. He too struck the water,
                                    then he followed their trail to the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> ’s home. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> had
                                    changed his skin into that of a man. He had taken the woman, and
                                    they were planting yams (mami) in a garden. The man followed
                                    them to their home and looked around. He saw a large spirit
                                    house and went inside it. He saw all kinds of skins, from pigs,
                                    dogs, cassowaries, snakes, and other animals. He came outside,
                                    then went to a house and saw an old woman. He took her fire and
                                    made it bigger, then he lit the spirit house. Then he went back
                                    and cooked the breadfruit that he had picked. The skin of the
                                    men who were planting yams became very hot, so they sent the
                                    woman to fetch water. However, all of the water was dried up.
                                    The woman returned to the garden and saw that the men had died.
                                    She returned to the village and saw that the spirit house was on
                                    fire, so she went back to her husband. They cooked the
                                    breadfruits and ate them, then they went home. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was an old woman who lived near a river called
                                    Navarao. This woman lived with two small grandsons. Her name was
                                    Didikalom. She always told her grandsons, “Don’t go wandering
                                    about, just stay within sight of our house.” The old woman often
                                    went to the garden and returned. When she did this, she would
                                    say, “Mus-muskip.” meaning “Close, hole.” Later she would say,
                                    “Mus-mus gran,” meaning “Open, cave.” Later, the two young boys
                                    heard their grandmother saying these things. When the old woman
                                    was at the garden, the two boys tried to talk to the cave. After
                                    the cave opened, they took spears, went inside the hole and
                                    speared some <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> . Then all of the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> went out and splashed in the
                                    water. The old woman heard the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> splashing in the water. She
                                    ran and called out, “Hey you two, what are you doing in that
                                    stone?” Later, she could not catch the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> that had left the stone. She
                                    ran and jumped in the middle of the river. She wanted to stop
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> , but
                                    she was unable to do so. All of the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> had escaped and now they live
                                    everywhere. The old woman was ashamed now and she sat in the
                                    Navarao River. She left her two grandsons and did not return.
                                    Now, when you see <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> , you know that they originated from the Navarao River.

                                    to make bracelets or armbands for themselves. They walked into
                                    the forest, then looked up and saw a ghost woman sitting on a
                                    branch like a marsupial (kapul). The younger kinsman told the
                                    older one, “Kinsman, I’m going up there to kill her.” The elder
                                    kinsman said, “No, stay here on the ground.” So, the elder
                                    kinsman climbed the tree but he did not see the marsupial. He
                                    saw a house, went inside and saw a young woman there. The woman
                                    asked Juebangu [the elder kinsman], “Why did you come up here?”
                                    The man replied, “I saw a marsupial sitting on the tree branch,
                                    so I came up here.” The woman said, “It wasn’t a marsupial. It
                                    was me sitting in the sun.” The younger kinsman called out to
                                    Juebangu. Juebangu replied, but his kinsman did not hear him. He
                                    only heard a kambu <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> calling. The younger kinsman called out again, then
                                    Juebangu replied. A torrential rain with tornadoes came. The
                                    little relative cut a big tree and went in the middle of it to
                                    hide. The ghost woman hid Juebangu in a basket. The father and
                                    mother of the ghost woman had left to process sago. When they
                                    returned to the house, the ghost woman was crying. The mother
                                    thought her child was crying because she was hungry. The mother
                                    quickly cooked some food and gave it to the ghost woman, but she
                                    did not want to eat it. The mother asked, “Why are you crying?”
                                    The daughter did not reply to her mother. So, the mother asked
                                    again, “Why? Are you hiding a man and crying because of that?”
                                    The daughter said, “Yes, mama.” The mother called the father to
                                    come up to the house. The woman told him, “Our daughter is
                                    hiding a man and crying.” The ghost man called out to all his
                                    families. Some of them took spears and bone daggers for shooting
                                    the ghost woman. He pointed at the man [Juebangu]. The two of
                                    them were similarly tall and stout. So they did not shoot the
                                    man [Juebangu], So then the two of them married [Juebangu and
                                    the ghost woman]. At this time, many of us often became lost in
                                    the forest. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was a man who lived on Tumeleo [Tumleo] Island
                                    [Tumleo People, West Sepik Province], This man had a garden that
                                    was near a huge callophyllum tree. When he went to work in the
                                    garden and he wanted to urinate, he always urinated at the base
                                    of this callophyllum tree. There was a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> that lived inside a hole in
                                    the callophyllum tree where the man urinated. The man urinated
                                    on this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    often and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> became pregnant. Later, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> gave birth to two boys named
                                    Kairoro and Lesautum. The two boys lived in the hole in the
                                    callophyllum tree with their <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> mother until they grew as big
                                    as five-year olds. One time their mother told them, “Look at
                                    that man who always works in this garden. He’s your father. Go
                                    and ask him for some food.” The two boys went up to the man and
                                    said to him, “Father, mother sent us to you to ask you to give
                                    us some food.” The man thought, “Where did these boys come from
                                    who are calling me father?” So, whenever the two boys came to
                                    ask him for food, he would spy on where they returned to after
                                    he gave them food. He always saw them go down the hole in the
                                    tree where he urinated. One time he asked them, “Where do you
                                    live and where do you come from? Where does your mother live?
                                    Who told you that I’m your father?” They spoke, “Our house is in
                                    the hole at the base of the callophyllum tree. Our mother lives
                                    in the hole. She told us that you pissed on her and then she
                                    gave birth to us.” When their father heard this, he took them to
                                    the village. They often cooked food and brought some to their
                                    mother. This went on for some time, then the two boys became big
                                    men. One time their father told them, “Go get your mother and
                                    bring her here.” So, they made a big basket and brought their
                                    mother to the village. When their father saw the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> , he was
                                    terrified. He did not want them to put the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> mother in
                                    the house, so they put her underneath the house. One time, the
                                    two men went to see the ocean. They paddled far asea and they
                                    could not see their island. They caught some <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> , then
                                    they saw a piece of ash blowing in the wind. The ash fell
                                    directly into the canoe. They saw this and they thought and
                                    thought. They felt queasy. They said, “There’s probably
                                    something wrong in the village.” So, they paddled back to the
                                    village. When they arrived, they saw that their house had burned
                                    down. Their father had burned their mother. They cried together
                                    and made a basket from coconut palm leaves. They filled the
                                    basket with their mother’s bones. They left the island and went
                                    to the mainland. </p>

                              <p> Many years ago, there was an old blind woman who lived on an
                                    island. The woman was lucky because she had a son who lived with
                                    her and took care of her. [The mother said,] “I want you to take
                                    care of me.” Her son agreed. One time, the man told his mother,
                                    “I’ve selected a woman that I shall marry.” The mother said,
                                    “You can’t leave. If you marry this woman, you two must live
                                    with me.” So, they married and they went to live with the old
                                    blind woman. The wife helped take care of the old woman very
                                    well. However after a long time, the woman began to get angry.
                                    [She told her husband,] “I hate this house. I don’t like taking
                                    care of your mother. I want a house of my own.” So the two of
                                    them made a house on the other side of the island. The old woman
                                    became mournful because her son had left her. She could not
                                    catch <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span>
                                    because she was blind, and she could not work in the garden, so
                                    she had no food. When the rainy season arrived, she was very
                                    cold because her house was falling apart and there was no man to
                                    fix her house. The married couple lived well in their house, but
                                    sometimes the son thought of his mother and was sorry. Before
                                    long, his wife bore a son. The man heard his wife singing his
                                    son to sleep, so he spoke to her, “When I was still a little
                                    boy, my mother was old and she loved me.” So, he thought about
                                    preparing to visit his mother. He took some food from the garden
                                    and brought it to her. He lived with his mother for two days. He
                                    caught <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> and
                                    fixed the house well. Then he said good-bye to his mother and
                                    returned. [When he returned, he asked,] “Will you, my wife,
                                    bring some food and firewood?” After he said this, the wife was
                                    furious, but she followed his request. The man told her to get
                                    two big <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span>
                                    and cook them for his mother. The two of them ate a little of
                                    it, then the wife carried the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> away. While the wife was
                                    working on the old woman’s house, she found three lizards. She
                                    made a fire and cooked them with some leaves from the deep
                                    forest. She took some banana leaves, then covered it up and took
                                    it to the old woman. She told her that it was <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> , so the
                                    old woman said thank you and the wife left. The old woman was
                                    not hungry at that time, so she left the food for another day.
                                    The man came to work for his mother. He brought his son to show
                                    to her. His mother was happy that she had a grandson. Then the
                                    man worked in the garden and he became very hungry. The mother
                                    gave him the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> lizard
                                    </span> meat. He smelled a strange smell, but he was hungry and
                                    he ate it. The mother told him, “Yesterday, a young woman came
                                    to see me and she told me that her husband had died. She asked
                                    me to live with her in her house. She spoke nicely, so I wanted
                                    to live with her.” As the mother told this story, the man was
                                    turning into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          crocodile </span> . His mouth became longer and longer and
                                    his skin became hard. [He asked,] “What kind of food did you
                                    give me?” The mother told him, “I don’t know. Your wife gave it
                                    to me.” She did not know where her son went or that her son had
                                    turned into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile
                                    </span> . Her son was angry now. He said good-bye to her, and
                                    returned home. He was irate and he had not thought about
                                    bringing back his son. Before long, his wife saw the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span>
                                    coming. She was afraid and fled. “Don’t run away,” said the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span>
                                    , “I’m your husband. What did you do with the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> that
                                    turned me into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          crocodile </span> ?” However, the wife was still running
                                    away, so the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile
                                    </span> followed her. She swam in the sea, but the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span> still
                                    followed her. They went down into the sea, so then there was no
                                    one to look after the old woman or the young boy. The blind
                                    woman did not know why her son did not return. So, the old woman
                                    took her grandson and lived with him. This is the origin of the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span>

                              <p> In a house, there lived two brothers named Tauan and Kuiman. The
                                    meaning of both these names is “bamboo sprout.” \Tau is a kind
                                    of bamboo used for water containers and bowstrings. Kuima is a
                                    kind of wild bamboo (Lang, 1973: 47, 101).] They lived happily,
                                    they had good food, they made good gardens, and they had
                                    everything they needed. One day, the big brother told the little
                                    brother, “Tomorrow, I want to go to the forest to find some
                                    marsupials (ka-pul). I’ll return on the third day. So, you must
                                    prepare everything for us to cook the marsupials in an earth
                                    oven.” The [elder] brother collected some food and departed. He
                                    walked and walked and climbed a mountain. Then he caught his
                                    breath. He heard a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> howl below, where he wanted to go. This man, Tauan,
                                    heard the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    howling and he followed this sound. He left the mountain and
                                    went down. He found a black <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> underneath a tree. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> was happy
                                    to see the man and made a noise by wagging its tail. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> pointed
                                    with its leg to another tree where he saw a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> that was
                                    tied up with a rope. Then the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> showed him how to remove the
                                    ropes from the tree. The man did as the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> showed him.
                                    The man removed the ropes from the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> , then held the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> in his
                                    hands. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    made a wagging noise with his tail and right away he went past a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> . The
                                    man just followed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> . They arrived at a clearing and saw a nice
                                    place that had good food, a good house and other nice things.
                                    The man saw all of these things and was very happy. He just
                                    followed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> . The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> jumped and showed him a huge tree. The man thought, “The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> is
                                    telling me to cut the tree.” So the man cut it. After he
                                    finished, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> showed him leaves, vegetables and edible greens for
                                    cooking the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span>
                                    in an earth oven. So, the man gathered all of these things that
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> had
                                    showed him. Then the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> showed him a stick for hitting the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> on the
                                    snout andD73 killing it. The man cut the stick and hit the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> on the
                                    snout. The man cut the stick and killed the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> , then they
                                    cooked it in the earth oven. While they were eating the pieces
                                    of meat, the man just ate the bones and gave the good meat to
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> . The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> felt
                                    good. After the man finished removing the meat from the earth
                                    oven, he heard the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> doing something. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> gave all of the pork and other
                                    meat to him. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> only kept the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          pig </span> ’s head. He gave everything else to the man.
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> gave
                                    him many kina shells and other things, then sent the man away.
                                    The man went back to his village. His brother was very happy to
                                    see him. He gave his brother much meat, but he did not want to
                                    eat it because he was strongly opposed to his brother going to
                                    that place. It would be bad to ruin the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s place.
                                    However the brother said, “If you send me to the place that you
                                    went to, then I must eat.” No, he was strongly opposed to his
                                    brother going to this place. It would be bad if he ruined the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s
                                    place. So the next day, he learned well the things that his
                                    brother did, then he was sent away. He climbed the mountain and
                                    he heard the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> howling, then he ran down. He saw the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> right away
                                    and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> was
                                    happy to see him, but then the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> felt bad because this man was
                                    not his friend. The man shouted at the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> , “Where’s the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> that you
                                    tied up?” The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> walked slowly and showed him. Then the man asked the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ,
                                    “Where’s your home? I want to kill the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> and eat it.” So, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> walked
                                    slowly to its home. The man shouted again, “Never mind this slow
                                    walking, run fast.” So, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> followed the man’s
                                    instructions. They arrived at the home and the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> showed him
                                    all of the things that he had shown to the first brother.
                                    However the man did not like this and he spoke, “I’m only
                                    working for my own desires. Never mind yourself.” He killed the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> for
                                    himself alone and later he just gave the bones to the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> . The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ate the
                                    bones, and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> ’s mouth and teeth became bloody. The man injured the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> and
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> came
                                    close to death. He listened to the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> , then he cooked the entirety
                                    of the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s
                                    food and left. The man went back to his house and his brother
                                    saw that something was not right. His brother asked him, “What
                                    happened? Did the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> give things to you?” The man replied, “Yes, yes.” Then
                                    the brother cried and cried. In the early morning, he went to
                                    look for the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> , and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> was near death. The man arrived and the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> told him,
                                    “You must send that man to me. He beat me and I waited for you
                                    because I’m going to die. We must kill his body.” The man cried
                                    and put the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    in a grave. Then he returned and killed his brother and he died
                                    too. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    had made friends with a man, but the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> was ruined. </p>

                              <p> Once there was a man and a woman who walked into the forest to
                                    hunt wild game. They walked and walked, then arrived at the base
                                    of a galip tree. They had sex at this place. Later, a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> came
                                    and saw the galip nuts and ate them. Then the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> laid
                                    some eggs. The eggs hatched, and what came out? They were <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    chicks, except for one that was a boy. The mother <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> took
                                    the chicks around the forest. She found food for them for the
                                    first time by kicking a banana plant, causing ripe bananas to
                                    fall. The chicks were happy and cried out together, then ate the
                                    banana. However, the boy did not know how to eat wild banana, so
                                    he just stood there and held one. The mother tried all of the
                                    kinds of <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> food, but the boy did not eat them. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    thought and brought them to someone’s garden. She took some of
                                    the people’s bananas, then gave them to the boy. She explained
                                    how to eat it, but the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> chicks just stood there in confusion,
                                    “What’s he eating in the people’s garden?” The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> saw
                                    this [the boy eating the bananas] and took him to everyone’s
                                    gardens. Then he finished off all of the food, and only one
                                    banana plant was left. The owner of this garden had made a big
                                    hole and covered up the hole. He was hiding when the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> took
                                    her children to the banana plant. The chicks were standing in
                                    confusion. The boy ate the bananas. He ate and ate. Then he
                                    wanted to get the ripe banana that was on top of the leaf that
                                    was covering up the hole. He fell down the side of the hole, and
                                    oh my, the mother was angry. She kicked her legs at the hole.
                                    But the boy was lost. The man walked forward and the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    chased him. He ran away and told his brother, then the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> ran
                                    away and told her sister too. They fought and fought, then they
                                    shot the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> mother’s eye. She said, “That boy is my child. I’m
                                    leaving now, take care of him well.” The men took him from the
                                    hole and returned to the village. He grew up and was given two
                                    wives. Later, they angered him and he worried about his mother.
                                    So, he left for the deep forest. He came to his mother and she
                                    said, “Why have you come? They ruined my eye in the fight over
                                    you, so I ran away. Haven’t they taken care of you well?” The
                                    two wives ran away and followed him. They stayed with the man’s
                                    mother. Later, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> mother’s son shot her again. He
                                    butchered his mother, then cooked the meat and bones for his
                                    clan. Now, we people from Nuku Village and some people from the
                                    Dreikikir area have a name for these men, they are called mami
                                    (yam) and <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> . They are numerous in the Nuku area [Mehek People, West
                                    Sepik Province]. Before, we did not have mami. When this son
                                    shot his mother, that was when we obtained it. Now there is a

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was no fighting in the Highlands. There were
                                    two brothers with the same father and mother. The elder was
                                    named Sambe [Sambe (Lang, 1973: 214)] and the younger was
                                    Kunalin. The brothers did not have wives. They each had a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> . One time,
                                    when there was a bright moon, they prepared some food. They
                                    carried the food, bows [and arrows], then went away to hunt
                                    marsupials (kapul) in the forest with their dogs. They went into
                                    the deep forest and put their food in a hunting hut. They walked
                                    around in the forest and killed many kinds of marsupials. They
                                    carried the marsupials back to the hut. They cooked some of the
                                    marsupials in an earth oven and ate them. In the morning, they
                                    wrapped up the marsupials and returned home. They walked very
                                    far. They approached a trail and had a smoke. Their dogs had
                                    ropes tied to their necks. After they finished smoking, they got
                                    up and continued walking. The young brother, Kunalin, went first
                                    with his <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ,
                                    and his big brother, Sambe, followed. The first brother saw his
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> get
                                    loose of his rope and go ahead, so he asked his brother, “Hey!
                                    Hey! Sambe, can you get my <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> ’s rope? It came loose nearby
                                    and I lost it.” The big brother Sambe said, “No, I can’t get it.
                                    I think it’s lost in the forest.” The little brother said, “No,
                                    I had it at the place where we sat and smoked, so it’s not in
                                    the forest. “If you get it, give it back to me.” The big brother
                                    Sambe said, “No, I don’t see your worthless <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s rope.”
                                    After he said this, he ran past his brother. The little brother,
                                    Kunalin, followed him, then held onto him and took his net bag.
                                    He looked inside, then he found and took back his <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s rope.
                                    The big brother, Sambe, was ashamed that he had stolen this, so
                                    he strung his bow and shot [at] Kunalin. Then [Kunalin] too took
                                    his bow out and the two brothers fought. The two brothers fought
                                    and fought. The people along the trail and the village watched
                                    them fighting with bows and arrows and shouting at each other.
                                    The men from around the village and gardens heard their
                                    shouting. They also took their bows [and arrows], then went to
                                    the fight. Many people helped Sambe, and many others helped
                                    Kunalin. The fight continued on to the whole of Enga Province.
                                    The big brother, Sambe, chased away the group that was fighting
                                    with Kunalin to Sirungi [Sirunki] Village, near the border
                                    between Wabag and Laiagam [Enga People]. Now, they call this
                                    clan Kunalin [Kunalini (Lang, 1973: 215)]. The big brother’s
                                    clan is in Papayuku Village. This clan is large now and is
                                    called Sambe. These two brothers had started the fighting; it
                                    was the first time in Enga Province. They continued this
                                    fighting, and so fights have arisen many times and have spread
                                    to other places, such as Mount Hagen, Simbu Province, Eastern
                                    Highlands Province, and the rest of Papua New Guinea. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, in the time of the ancestors, there was a woman
                                    named Newa who lived in Hanyiak [Hanyak Village, Boiken People,
                                    East Sepik Province]. This woman went and lived at a place on
                                    the beach where the sea crashed and swirled. The ancestors took
                                    this land by my village and covered it over, making a hill, then
                                    they fenced it off. There is no sea that goes to my village.
                                    This woman, Newa, wanted to return to her place that was closed
                                    off by a hill that blocked the sea. There was no path to go to
                                    this place, so she became confused and turned into a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> lizard </span> . There
                                    was also a man who came from near Passam Village. He transformed
                                    into a tree’s shadow. This man stayed at the tree and descended
                                    to ask the woman, “Hey, what are you, a ghost or a woman?” The
                                    woman asked him, “And you too, what are you? Are you a tree
                                    spirit or a real man?” Then the two of them married. The man’s
                                    name was Mifariki. The man and woman came to live on this land
                                    called Huasufawu. They were the first man and woman who lived on
                                    this land. They lived there and raised children. Now you can see
                                    Yake with his brother Muraki living there. Their maternal
                                    relatives left to live at Worn. This is how Kremendin
                                    [Kremending] Village originated. The women of my village
                                    originated from this place. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was an old man who lived in a village. One day, he
                                    crossed a river named Bale. After he crossed the river, he went
                                    into the sea and began to catch <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> . The river ran strongly into
                                    the sea with many <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> , sea grasses, and plenty of trash. At this time, there
                                    was a village named Sera [Serai]. Every one of Sera was
                                    butchering a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle
                                    </span> on a Mam Beach. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> turtle </span> is called nausa in our
                                    language. Two of the women wanted to eat some <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span> . When
                                    the two went down to the beach, they saw many, many <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> that the
                                    waves had thrown ashore. They did not think any more about
                                    eating <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> turtle </span>
                                    with the others. No, they began to follow the shoreline and pick
                                    up all of the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> . While they were collecting the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> , they
                                    arrived at the river that the old man had crossed. Then the sun
                                    set. The old man saw the two women and he asked them, “Are you
                                    real women or ghost women?” The women said, “We’re real women.”
                                    They asked the old man, “Are you a real man or a ghost?” The old
                                    man said, “I’m a real man.” So, the three of them married and
                                    lived together. They had many descendants who populated this
                                    place. In this village called Leitre, the people originated from
                                    this man and these two women [Rawo People, West Sepik Province].

                              <p> Long ago, in the time of the ancestors, there were two women who
                                    lived in a place. There was not a single man there. The women
                                    usually just performed garden work, planting and harvesting
                                    yams. One time, the big sister told the little sister, “It would
                                    be better if we went to a new garden and took some yams there.”
                                    So, they went to the new garden, taking the big, long and good
                                    yams to put there. They slept that night. While they slept, a
                                    yam turned into a big, sleeping <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> . In the morning, they woke
                                    up and saw that the yam had turned into a sleeping <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> . They
                                    said to the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> , “Snake, you listen. We are asking you what you want.
                                    Whatever it is, we’ll give it to you.” The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> kept its
                                    eyes closed and continued to sleep. The big sister told the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    again that they would like to give him things, but he did not
                                    open his eyes, he just slept. The big sister asked him if he
                                    wanted her little sister. Then the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> opened his eyes and saw them
                                    there. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> married this woman. The names of these women were Yang
                                    and Yambiak. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> married Yang, and became a real man who lived with these
                                    two women and had many descendants. Now people have these two
                                    names, Yang and Yambiak. This story comes from Ambu in Madang
                                    Province [Monumbo People]. </p>

                              <p> In the deep forest, there was a place where men did not often
                                    travel. In this place, many kinds of dogs gathered. This was the
                                    dogs’ home. They each had a house where each <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> family
                                    lived. When the dogs had a big meeting or when they had a party,
                                    they always gathered in the house of a family. They also had a
                                    playground where they often played soccer, volleyball,
                                    basketball and other games. One beautiful afternoon, a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> thought
                                    that it would be a good day to play soccer. So, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> spoke to
                                    the other groups of dogs about this. After they all heard this,
                                    they agreed to play soccer. The young and strong dogs sent their
                                    children and the aged to sit in their houses. The young dogs
                                    divided themselves up well, then began to play. On one side,
                                    there were one hundred dogs. These were both strong he- and
                                    she-dogs. They had five goalies. The other side had strong dogs
                                    too. There were no rules. They often just kicked with their legs
                                    and moved the ball with their snouts. The ball was not very
                                    large, because they used tree fruits. They played hard and
                                    diligently, but some dogs were not happy. While they played,
                                    some dogs held others by the tail. When one <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> shook the
                                    leg of another, ten or twenty others would awkwardly fall on the
                                    other side. So, they all stopped playing. They agreed to remove
                                    their tails and hang them on the soccer ground’s fence. After
                                    they had hung their tails, they began playing again. The poor
                                    dogs were not just fooling around, the sun was hot. Some were
                                    badly injured, but they continued to get hotter. In the middle
                                    of the game, a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> looked back at their tails that were hanging on the
                                    fence. At first the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> thought the tails were OK. But no, he saw a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> digging in
                                    the ground near the fence. Then the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> moved the fence and all of the
                                    tails fell. The poor, strong dogs tried to find their tails
                                    immediately. However, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> had mixed all of the tails and
                                    the dogs could not find their own tails. These dogs were not
                                    boys, they were a big group. So, they just put on whichever
                                    tails they could find. Now we can see that when one <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> sees
                                    another, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> will run to smell the tail of the other. That is because
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> is
                                    trying to find its lost tail from the time when the dogs played
                                    soccer. We often see each <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> looking for its tail like this.
                                    If a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> smells
                                    another <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s
                                    tail that does not belong to the first <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> , we often see that the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> just smells
                                    it and leaves. However, if this <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> finds that the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> has put on
                                    its tail, we will see them fight. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was no water in Lake Kutubu in Southern Highlands
                                    Province. At that time, many people did not have water and they
                                    hungered for it. There is a place near Kutubu called Topua
                                    Village [Tobua Village, Mendi People]. This place did not have
                                    many people, there were just a young woman and a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> . They had
                                    plenty of food in the their garden. They often ate various kinds
                                    of food, but they had no water to drink. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> always
                                    tricked the young woman, because the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> often went to the forest to
                                    drink water. One day, the woman told the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> to go find
                                    water in the forest, but the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> told her, “You’re crazy, woman.
                                    Where am I going to find this water that you’re talking about?”
                                    The young woman was ashamed and said, “Never mind, let’s go into
                                    the house.” They went into the house, then the young woman
                                    cooked some sweet potatoes. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> finished eating, then went into
                                    the forest to get some water. Afterwards, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> returned to
                                    their home. They went to sleep. In the morning, they awoke,
                                    cooked sweet potatoes and ate them. Later, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> again went
                                    to get some water. When the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> returned to the house, the
                                    young woman looked at the hairs around the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s nose.
                                    She saw that a little water was still on its hairs. This time,
                                    the young woman thought hard. The young woman worked at winding
                                    a rope. She worked at making the rope for one month. Then one
                                    time after the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> had eaten and was about to leave, the young woman took
                                    the rope and tied it to the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> ’s tail. She followed the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> closely and
                                    she saw the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    go close to a rotting tree. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> went up a big fig tree, then
                                    drank some water. Later when the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> tried to get down, it was
                                    unable to do so. The young woman shouted to the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> , “Hey,
                                    hey, what are you doing?” The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> was ashamed and said, “I drank
                                    some water.” Then the young woman held onto the big tree and it
                                    fell apart. Oh my! Water fell everywhere. The young woman was
                                    near the water and wanted to get it. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> said, “/ pu
                                    Kutubu yura yu tengteng” This means, “Lake Kutubu, you can’t
                                    become larger.” Then the water was still. The name of the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> was Nol and
                                    the name of the woman was Temoki. When we go to Kutubu, we often
                                    see this big fig tree in the very middle of the lake. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ’s marking
                                    is on this tree. When you go to Kutubu, you can see many dogs in
                                    the area around the lake. If this young woman had not done as
                                    she had in the Southern Highlands, we would not be able to drink
                                    water there. We would only be eating sweet potatoes, and only
                                    the dogs would be drinking water. You would not be able to see
                                    the water, and you would not be able to see Lake Kutubu where it
                                    is now. </p>

                              <p> A very long time ago, the Fly River ran between Olsobip [Village]
                                    and Telifomin [Telefomin Village, Telefol or Faiwol People, West
                                    Sepik or Western Province]. At this place, there was a lake with
                                    a she- <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile
                                    </span> that was guarding her eggs. This <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span> ’s
                                    husband was hunting for food, and he had killed a wild <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> . The
                                    husband ate some of the pork, then cut a piece of leg and
                                    carried it back to his wife. There was also a big python that
                                    lived at this lake. The python was also hunting for food, but it
                                    was unable to find any. So, near dawn, the python returned home.
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span>
                                    husband returned and gave the food to his wife, then he wanted
                                    to go down to the lake. The python’s head was already in the
                                    lake, but its body was on the shore. There was only one path
                                    that the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile
                                    </span> liked to take, so the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> crocodile </span> followed the path and
                                    came down to the lake. Oh my! The python was already there, so
                                    the python grabbed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          crocodile </span> and the two of them wrestled. The python
                                    defeated the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile
                                    </span> and killed him. Then the python drank some water and
                                    swallowed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile
                                    </span> . The python wanted to go down in the water, but it
                                    could not do so because it was stuck where it had eaten the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crocodile </span>
                                    . Three men from the Telifomin area followed the Fly River and
                                    arrived at this place, finding the python. They slaughtered the
                                    python and left it to die and rot at this place. Then the three
                                    men returned home. </p>

                              <p> A. long time ago, in the time of the ancestors, in the area near
                                    Erap, there were two villages [Munkip, Numan gang, Sauk, Gusan,
                                    Finungwa, Nimi or Urii People, Madang Province]. One village was
                                    small and high up, and the other was big and down below. When
                                    the people of these two villages all went to their gardens,
                                    there was a masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          snake </span> that turned into a small boy and played with
                                    the other little boys of the villages. In the evening, the
                                    little boy would return home, turn back into a python and go to
                                    sleep. When the adults went back the gardens, the masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> already
                                    would have turned into a little boy and be coming to play with
                                    the little boys in the villages. The masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> did this
                                    many times. There was an old woman who lived with her
                                    grandchildren. One day while her grandchildren were playing, the
                                    masalai python turned into a little boy and went inside to play
                                    with them. The grandmother saw that there was another face, and
                                    she thought, “This boy, whose child is that?” She looked at him,
                                    and then she looked harder. In the evening, the old woman did
                                    not see this boy. She looked but she only saw her grandchildren.
                                    This was the first time that she had seen him, so she spoke
                                    unclearly to the big men that she had seen him and lost him.
                                    Another day, the masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > snake </span> returned and played with the little boys
                                    again. The old woman saw him and said, “Hey you there. You
                                    tricked me. Now I know about you.” In the evening, the adults
                                    returned from the gardens and she told them, “When all of you go
                                    to the gardens, a masalai python often comes to play with your
                                    children.” After the old woman said this, the adults were truly
                                    irate. One day, they decided to kill the masalai. The old woman
                                    stopped them and said, “Don’t kill it. Let it be. It’s the same
                                    as my ancestor.” However, the men did not believe what she said.
                                    They told the old woman, “You’re a bloody old worthless woman.
                                    You leave it alone. What will you do about it?” The old woman
                                    just cried. They decided to prepare food, edible greens, and
                                    firewood, and to clean the pots. After they finished the
                                    preparations, one of them sharpened his stone axe. He sharpened
                                    it until it was very sharp. Then he tried to cut a rope, and he
                                    cut it in one attempt. After they finished all of the
                                    preparations, they called the python to come eat with them. The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> did
                                    not know that they wanted to kill him. The poor old woman and
                                    one of her grandchildren were crying and crying. When they left,
                                    their explanations finished. The man who had sharpened the axe
                                    put a tree branch on the path that the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> had to cross. The masalai
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> did
                                    not know about this. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > snake </span> just came and put his head on the branch,
                                    then the man put his axe down and cut the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s neck.
                                    After they killed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          snake </span> , they cut him into little pieces and cooked
                                    him with food in a can. When the water boiled, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s head
                                    did not die. It was still moving its eyes. The poor old woman
                                    [and] her grandchild took the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> ’s belly. She took the belly
                                    to the stream and removed the guts. The water was dirty and she
                                    told the men, “Men, this water is too dirty.” Some women told
                                    her, “The pigs dug the earth at the headwaters, so the stream is
                                    dirty.” However, the old woman and her grandchild were through.
                                    They did not want to eat what had been cooked. It was becoming
                                    dark, then the python came and spoke to two old women and their
                                    grandchildren, “You two can’t sleep here. Wait for me.” Everyone
                                    who ate appeared at the village. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> sent the two of them to a
                                    small mountain to stay and watch. While they were watching, a
                                    big lake arose and killed the people from these two villages. If
                                    you go to this area near Erap and look, there is a small place
                                    with a pond that marks the place where the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ruined
                                    the villages. Inside the pond, it is pitch black. In the second
                                    place where they killed masalai <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> , there is a red pond because
                                    of the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s
                                    blood. If you go to this place and look, you will see some short
                                    snakes without heads. Now there are two ponds, they call these
                                    ponds Guankaya. In our language, this means “Fighting ponds.”

                              <p> Long, long ago, there were no people anywhere on earth. There were
                                    only three people who lived in the middle of the earth. In the
                                    middle of all of the land was the sea. There was also a long
                                    [mountain] that was completely filled with all kinds of animals,
                                    large and small. These three people were women. The mother was
                                    an old woman, her first daughter was a big woman, and her little
                                    daughter was a young woman. One time, the old woman and her two
                                    daughters went up the long mountain. They stood on top of the
                                    mountain and looked at all of the earth. However, they did not
                                    see any people on the other side. The old woman thought that
                                    when they returned to their home, she would study her thoughts
                                    about wanting to make people and sending them to all of the
                                    other places on earth. When the old woman finished thinking, she
                                    thought, “If I burn them, I’ll kill my two children. Their ashes
                                    would make many people arise in all of the places of the earth,
                                    then I myself would be their great ancestor.” The three of them
                                    went to the center of the earth and made a trap for all of the
                                    kinds of wild game. When they made traps, they did not just make
                                    an ordinary trap for pigs, nor did they just make it for the
                                    size of pigs. They thought of <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cattle </span> , birds, snakes, and every
                                    kind of wild game, and then they made different sized traps for
                                    them. The old woman said, “If the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> ’s trap or the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> ’s trap
                                    shuts, or if the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> ’s trap or the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          bird </span> ’s trap shuts, it would be bad. If the
                                    animals go directly to their traps, we’ll not be able to bring
                                    forth people all over the earth.” They finished the traps and
                                    they slept. The next morning, they went to look at their traps.
                                    They saw that the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> ’s trap had shut. All kinds of wild game had gone
                                    directly into the traps. The three women were happy together and
                                    carried the animals back to their home. The mother made a round
                                    house and closed it tightly with strong fences. When the house
                                    was finished, she put the two children with the net bag of game
                                    inside this house. She gave an order to the children to eat all
                                    of the game. Then she closed the door of the round house very
                                    tightly. The mother left them and went to live far away from
                                    these places. The first sister looked after the bag of game and
                                    ate them. When the mother came to check on them, the big sister
                                    said, “We’re still eating.” However, she was lying, the little
                                    sister had not eaten. The little sister was very hungry. The
                                    second time that the mother came to check on them, the second
                                    sister said, “We finished eating all of the game. Now we’re
                                    starting to eat the net bag.” The old woman heard this and
                                    started to burn the round house. She made a fire on four sides.
                                    The old woman burned her two children inside the round house,
                                    then she went far away to the other side of the sea. She lived
                                    in the middle of the earth. She lived there for some days, then
                                    returned again to see the frogs turning into people. She was
                                    their ancestor now, but these descendants began to fight among
                                    themselves. Because of the ashes of the sister who had not eaten
                                    the game, two groups of siblings were beginning to fight. The
                                    old woman saw this and returned home. She thought again, and she
                                    wanted to give a name to each group of people, and give them
                                    each a style of dress. The old woman studied and thought, then
                                    she returned to see her groups of descendants threatening each
                                    other with bows and arrows. They were severely punishing each
                                    other in battle. The origin of this anger was the group that had
                                    come from the little sister who had not eaten the game. The
                                    group that had come from the little sister was fighting with the
                                    group from the big sister. The old woman saw this and returned
                                    to her home. She began to make bark loincloths, “grass” skirts,
                                    knives and axes. [She] thought of the people who live by the sea
                                    who would make canoes, those who live who live in the forest who
                                    just exist, and the white people who would make ships, cars, and
                                    airplanes. The old woman finished thinking and took all of this
                                    cargo, then sent it to each of all of the peoples on the earth.
                                    When the old woman returned, the descendants were not there.
                                    They had voyaged upon the sea. The old woman stood up and called
                                    out. They replied, calling out from the other sides of the
                                    water. She called out again to them. They called out again to
                                    her sides. This is because when she had made a fire at the round
                                    house, she made a fire on four sides. So, the descendants called
                                    out from four sides. Along the sea, there was a big tree in the
                                    ground that had a hole in it. The old woman’s descendants went
                                    inside the hole and the old woman found them. The old woman took
                                    an axe and first cut the sides of the native people. Then she
                                    pulled them out from the tree hole. She gave names to the groups
                                    of people and divided them up. She gave styles of dress to each
                                    group. She shot them [out?] and put them in all of the places on
                                    the earth. After she divided all of the natives, she cut the old
                                    tree again and pulled all of the white people out of the tree
                                    hole that the axe had made. The old woman divided them and gave
                                    them their style of dress. She took a scrap of wood that had
                                    fallen from the tree when she had cut it and gave it to them.
                                    She put them on top of the water and sent them across the water,
                                    saying, “You can use this piece of wood from the axe on the sea.
                                    When you want to see another person of your group, you will sit
                                    on this tree and it will take you to see other people on the
                                    other side of the sea.” Then they departed. The sea took them to
                                    a shore where they lived. These three people are our three
                                    ancestors. When I was a small boy, I lived in my village. My
                                    grandfather told me this ancestor story. His name is Hapo, from
                                    Wantini Village, Upper Watut River [Hamtai People, Morobe
                                    Province]. My ancestor told me, “When you are big, you can go to
                                    different places and see people who speak different languages.
                                    They have round houses in these places. The men who live by the
                                    sea have yemva (meaning ship), boats and canoes. Now they speak
                                    all over the earth that they’ll still fight. Brothers will still
                                    fight. You’ll see.” He told this to me, so now if we look at all
                                    of the places of the earth, there are many round houses and
                                    ships on the sea. And brother still fights with brother all over
                                    the earth. </p>

                                    at the National Museum of Papua New Guinea. The contest was held
                                    to find different stories about PNG’s national <span

                                    paradise. The author, Daniel Kita Pari, is from Amboin in the
                                    upper Sepik River area, near the place where the mountains of
                                    Enga [Central Range] meet the Sepik River [Karawari People, East
                                    Sepik Province]. Long ago, there were no birds of paradise in my
                                    people’s forest, nor were there the kinds of calls that birds of
                                    paradise make now. There lived a married couple with two
                                    children, a boy and a big girl. The parents died and there were
                                    just the two children. The girl thought and thought, “I think
                                    that I should marry now. It would be easier for the two of us.
                                    With a husband, I could take care of my little brother.” So she
                                    married. The man that she married was a very good man. He always
                                    took care of his brother-in-law. But the sister was often angry
                                    with her little brother. One time, the woman and her little
                                    brother went into the forest to drain a small stream to catch
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> .
                                    They caught many <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> . The little brother was hungry and took some <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> to cook.
                                    The sister saw this, so she took a huge pile of sticks and beat
                                    her little brother badly. She tried to grab his neck and break
                                    it, but he hid his neck too quickly. He cried and cried, then
                                    went into the forest, greatly in pain. He found a place with
                                    various kinds of colored earth: yellow, red, brown and black. He
                                    sat and cried. Immediately he thought of something. He took a
                                    little red earth and some black and yellow earth, then rubbed
                                    his skin. He took the brown earth and rubbed his two hands with
                                    it. He took a little black earth and put it around his two eyes.
                                    Then he found a place with some sunshine. He sat on a log that
                                    was once a huge tree. While he sat there, his eyes spun around
                                    and he collapsed. At the same time that he collapsed, he turned
                                    into what we now a call a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> of paradise. He stayed there
                                    for some time on the ground. A little rain came down and washed
                                    his head. He was surprised and flew up to a tree branch, then
                                    called out. The sister heard this call and thought hard, “[I
                                    should] chase after my little brother who went into the forest.”
                                    So, she began to look for him. She arrived at the place where he
                                    painted his skin and became a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> of paradise. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> of
                                    paradise began to call out again. The woman saw him sitting on a
                                    tree branch. She thought and thought, then asked him, “Are you
                                    my little brother?” He called out stronger. The sister cried out
                                    loudly. She shouted to him, “Never mind that, come down here.”
                                    But he flew to another tree. He made the sister more worried and
                                    she cried harder. She went back to the place where they had
                                    caught the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span>
                                    . She took all of the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          fish </span> and threw them away. She cried and returned
                                    home. Her husband asked her what happened, and she told him
                                    about what had happened in the forest. Her husband was angry
                                    with her and beat her badly until she was halfdead. This was
                                    because the man liked his brother-in-law very much. He went to
                                    the spirit house and quickly explained to the men, “If you hear
                                    a different kind of call from a forest <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> that has yellow coloring like
                                    the purpur shrub, do not kill it. I will kill the man that
                                    shoots this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> .” So they asked him, “Did you make this happen?” He
                                    told them, “No. It was my little brother-in-law, he went with my
                                    sister.” Then he told them about the story of how he had turned
                                    into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> .
                                    After they listened to him, they went to the other houses and
                                    warned the women and children. They made an important law
                                    against shooting birds of paradise, which if broken would result
                                    in death. They began to shoot some, but only in secret. When
                                    they shot them, they were very worried and cried. So now, in my
                                    village, we usually do not shoot birds of paradise without a
                                    good reason. When we want to sing and dance, we shoot one.
                                    Regarding selling them, we often think of them as men. Why would
                                    we sell [a man] and take money? If you want to give one to a
                                    friend, you must give it without recompense. You must not get
                                    something in return. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, two people lived in a village. At this time, they
                                    did not have food where they lived. So, one day the man asked
                                    his wife, “Can we cut a sago palm or not?” The woman said,
                                    “Good. We’ll cut a huge sago palm for ourselves lest we became
                                    hungry.” The next day, they went together to cut a sago palm.
                                    They removed the spines from the trunk of the sago palm and the
                                    man struck the tree with a traditional [stone] axe. This place
                                    was high on a mountain. The two of them did not have
                                    European-style clothing, so they were wearing their traditional
                                    clothing. The man was wearing a penis gourd, his two testicles
                                    [scrotum] were just hanging out in the open. On his backside
                                    hung an old black net bag. He had an armlet on each arm and he
                                    had two <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span>
                                    tusks through his nose. The two tusks were curved and very long.
                                    While he was cutting the sago palm, his clothing got into a very
                                    awkward position. His wife too had poor clothing, she had a
                                    “grass” skirt covering her back and front. She had put <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> of
                                    paradise feathers on the front of her head and the man had done
                                    this too. His wife had prepared the things needed to process the
                                    sago. She put some small sticks in the ground near a pond.
                                    Afterwards, she carried the sago palm leafstalks and put them on
                                    top of the sticks that she had put in the ground [thus making a
                                    sluice for rinsing the sago]. It was almost noon and she went to
                                    see her husband at the base of the sago palm. Her husband pulled
                                    up two sago palm flower sheaths and she carried a sago palm
                                    leafstalk. She put a long sago palm leafstalk underneath the bag
                                    for rinsing the sago pith. At about three o’clock, the man
                                    stopped working and went to the house. He made a cigarette, then
                                    he took his bow and arrows and went to hunt wild game. His wife
                                    finished processing the sago and went to the house to cut some
                                    firewood. In the late afternoon, at about five o’clock, her
                                    husband brought back a white marsupial (kapul) [the spotted
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cuscus </span> ,
                                    Spilocuscus <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> maculatus </span>
                                    <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> maculatus </span>
                                    (Flannery, 1995a: 181-182)]. They butchered the marsupial and
                                    cooked it in an earth oven. At the same time they cooked plain
                                    sago in a fire and ate it with the marsupial. In the early
                                    morning, he went to hunt birds in the forest. He hunted and
                                    hunted, but he did not shoot a single <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> . He returned to the house,
                                    but near the house he shot one <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> called a wildfowl. He carried
                                    this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> to
                                    the house. The woman had gone to wash a sago palm leafstalk. The
                                    man cooked the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> and ate the entire thing. He did leave some for the
                                    wife, none at all. He just left the feathers. She was still
                                    pounding the sago pith. His wife returned to the house and saw
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span>
                                    feathers, so she went back to the place where she was processing
                                    sago. At this time, the wife killed a red ground <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> . She
                                    cooked this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> and then quickly, a big flood arose and covered her up.
                                    She drifted in the water, but she was dead. At this time, her
                                    husband ran away into the deep forest. This flooded area is
                                    still there today. The name of this place is called Dawia Plomb
                                    in my language, meaning, “It snatched one woman.” Today, some
                                    white people go to visit this pond. This pond is near Imonda
                                    [Village, Waris People, West Sepik Province]. The man’s name was
                                    Maiva and the woman’s name was Sawa. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, there were two friends, a marsupial (sikau) and a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> , who
                                    were indeed very good friends. When they wanted to eat, they
                                    often searched for food in the forest and ate it. When they
                                    defecated, their feces always just came out black. However, one
                                    time the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    left its friend, the marsupial, and went to a place that had
                                    coconuts. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat
                                    </span> quickly ran to the top of a coconut palm, cut some
                                    coconut and carried it down to the ground. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> took it and
                                    hid it near their house. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> rat </span> did this all of the time, and
                                    did not show this to the marsupial or share any. Every time the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> did
                                    this, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    it did not give even a tiny piece to the poor marsupial. One
                                    time, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    defecated, and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat
                                    </span> ’s feces were very white. The marsupial saw this and
                                    thought, “What did my friend do that made shit like that?” The
                                    marsupial tried and ate the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> rat </span> ’s feces. Wow, the marsupial
                                    ate the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> ’s
                                    feces and they were delicious, so the marsupial ate all of them.
                                    Later, the marsupial saw the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> rat </span> and asked, “Friend, why is it
                                    that we are good friends, but you didn’t tell me or give me a
                                    piece? If you had told me, I could have gotten some for us.” The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> had
                                    not wanted to do this because the marsupial could not climb
                                    trees. So, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat
                                    </span> tried to teach the marsupial to climb trees. After the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    finished the training, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> rat </span> explained where to find the
                                    coconuts. After a while, when everyone was sleeping, the
                                    marsupial climbed up but did not get just one. The marsupial was
                                    very surprised because it cut many stems and the coconuts fell
                                    to the ground. The owner of the coconut tree woke up, then woke
                                    all of the other people of the village. They watched the base of
                                    the coconut palm and one man went to the top. The marsupial took
                                    one big coconut and hit this man badly, knocking him down. The
                                    marsupial ran down, but the men watched the marsupial. They
                                    grabbed it and tied its legs and arms. At dawn, everyone went to
                                    the gardens. They removed taros, yams, and bananas to eat with
                                    this marsupial and to make a big party. Everyone returned to the
                                    village and sent a message to all of the villages to come for
                                    joyful singing and dancing. At dawn, they would kill the
                                    marsupial. This message went around and the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> heard it
                                    too. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    made a feather headdress for itself and one for its friend, the
                                    marsupial. At night the men chose an old man to watch the
                                    marsupial. They made a bonfire and he watched the marsupial. At
                                    this time, all of the other people from other villages had
                                    gathered and were singing and dancing. They were happy and
                                    waiting for dawn. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          rat </span> took the headdresses, a hand drum and other
                                    adornments, then arrived at the place where everyone had
                                    gathered. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat
                                    </span> met an old woman who was the wife of the man guarding
                                    the marsupial. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat
                                    </span> asked her, “Hey, do you know which house they put the
                                    marsupial?” The old woman said, “They put it in this house.” The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span> went
                                    inside the house and saw the old man watching the marsupial. Oh
                                    my, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    jumped up and fought the old man, throwing him into the fire.
                                    Then the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> rat </span>
                                    took its friend, the marsupial, and they went to where they were
                                    singing and dancing. They were still singing and dancing because
                                    it was not yet dawn. The two of them left for their home. At
                                    dawn, the men wanted to kill the marsupial and went to look for
                                    it, but they saw the man in the fire. They were irate. But where
                                    were they? They were happy at their home. Kongango from Saidor

                              <p> Long, long ago, there lived a married couple who had a son. This
                                    boy became big and often walked around. His father made a little
                                    bow and gave it to him to play with. One day, they went to their
                                    new yam garden to clean and straighten it, and to make posts for
                                    the yams to climb on. The two parents cleaned the garden and the
                                    boy went to shoot the yam sprouts with his bow. The yam sprouts
                                    broke and fell apart, so he laughed hard and was very happy. He
                                    did this for a while, then the mother thought, “He’s playing
                                    around and laughing.” She continued to remove the grass from
                                    around the yams. His father got up and saw his child. Oh my, oh
                                    my, the yam sprouts were lying roughly on the ground. He told
                                    his wife, “Look at your child, he’s weeding the grass and he’s
                                    excelled us.” (He spoke a code language to the woman.) The woman
                                    thought and got up to look. No, the yam sprouts were ruined and
                                    lying about on the ground. The child thought, “They don’t see
                                    me.” So, he continued to shoot the yam sprouts, shouting and
                                    laughing and being very happy. His mother shouted very loudly at
                                    him and hit him badly. She turned around and spoke angrily at
                                    her husband, “You. It’s your fault. You made the bow and gave it
                                    to him, so he ruined the yam sprouts. Now you two can’t eat. I
                                    won’t be able to cook food for you. Find it yourself in your
                                    garden and cook and eat it.” After she finished her tirade, she
                                    went to the house, cooked her food and ate it herself. The
                                    father called out to his child and said to him, “Mother is angry
                                    at us, so we can’t go home. We must go to a place where there
                                    are no people.” The boy listened to his father, then they began
                                    to walk into the very deep forest. The mother waited until late
                                    afternoon. She noticed that they did not come home quickly. She
                                    went to the yam garden again and called out for them, but they
                                    were not there. The mother called out very loudly, calling their
                                    names, but they were far away. She saw that their footprints
                                    went into the forest and she followed them. She kept walking
                                    until it was quite dark. She called out for them but they did
                                    not reply to her. She listened but they did not reply. They
                                    heard her approaching a little closer. The father told the boy,
                                    “Your mother’s coming closer now, so turn into a tree. I’ll turn
                                    into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    and go into a cave.” They talked and the mother came very close,
                                    so the boy turned into a tree and the father turned into a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> and fled
                                    into a cave. The mother came and looked for them, but they were
                                    not there. She began to cry for them. She could not look for
                                    them any more. So, she slept under the tree until dawn and then
                                    returned home. </p>

                              <p> Once there were some people who were processing sago. A completely
                                    worthless <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    with scabies came and walked on top of their sago. When they saw
                                    this, they took the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> and threw it on some sago palm thorns. The people, an
                                    old woman and her husband, told the good <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> to kill a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bandicoot </span>
                                    and then they would take the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> and remove the sago thorns from
                                    its body. Afterwards, they would take the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> to the
                                    house. At night, they ate food and they gave some to the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> to eat. The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> ate
                                    the food and looked at its plate. It was a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> ’s plate.
                                    The next morning, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          dog </span> woke up and went to the forest. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> removed his
                                    worthless skin, became a handsome man and returned to the house.
                                    When he came to the house, the old woman jumped in surprise. She
                                    cooked some food and took a plate that she used for friends. The
                                    man noticed this. He asked, “Whose plate is that?” The woman
                                    said, “It’s for you to eat with.” He said, “Yesterday, I ate on
                                    that one.” The woman said, “That’s the plate of a worthless
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> that
                                    has departed.” The man said, “No, that’s my plate.” After he
                                    said that, the old man told his wife that the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> had changed
                                    his skin. After they finished eating, the man went outside. He
                                    saw a coconut palm and he spoke to the couple. It was a tall
                                    coconut palm, and he told them to make a house on the top of the
                                    coconut palm. They went and built a house on top of the palm
                                    tree, then prepared all of their possessions to go up the palm
                                    tree. The man spoke and the old man listened, then the couple
                                    went on top of the coconut palm. The couple sat on top of the
                                    coconut palm and the man told them, “After you two hear my
                                    voice, something will happen.” Then he went down into a hole in
                                    the ground. The couple saw a big flood arise. People died all
                                    over. Some people tried to climb the tree, but they died. The
                                    flood almost came to the top of the coconut palm, but it
                                    crested. The man took a small, young coconut and said all of the
                                    things that the man had told him before. After he said these
                                    things, he blew on the coconut and threw it towards the ground.
                                    But the coconut hit the flooded area. They waited and the water
                                    receded until there was very little. The man took another
                                    coconut and threw it down again. This time, it fell on the
                                    ground and bounced far away. They took all of their belongings
                                    and went down to the ground. They saw that everyone in the area
                                    was dead. They traveled to all of the houses that had been
                                    destroyed and took all of the rings from the people who had
                                    died. Later, the man made a house and put the rings in this
                                    house. Another day, he went to cut an ironwood tree to use to
                                    carve people. He cut the tree, then it fell and broke apart.
                                    Some fell in a small pond that was nearby. He returned home and
                                    slept. In the morning, he went to carve people’s faces. When he
                                    arrived at the place where he had cut the ironwood tree, he saw
                                    a young girl sitting on top of the stump of the ironwood tree.
                                    He asked her, “Where did you come from?” The girl told him about
                                    everything that had happened to her. The man learned about her
                                    and took her home. He put her with her mother at the house. The
                                    man returned to carve people and threw them into the pond. He
                                    continued carving and as he carved women, they became real
                                    women. As he carved men, they became real men. Then the man
                                    wanted to make a spirit house. The people that the man had
                                    carved at night only worked on the house at night. After the
                                    spirit house was finished, he marked a day for a festival. This
                                    was the first time ever for a festival. The man and his wife and
                                    the child came to sing and dance with the others for the second
                                    time when they heard them call out from the forest. In the
                                    morning, the man took them. He made a man friends with [i.e.,
                                    have sex with] a woman, and a woman friends with a man. He did
                                    this for everyone, then they married and lived in this village.

                              <p> Long ago, there was a man named Repes who lived in Embi Village
                                    [Pembi Village, Mendi People, Southern Highlands Province]. This
                                    man never defecated or urinated; he was closed up. When he ate,
                                    his belly swelled up terribly. One time, he went over to a tree
                                    and climbed to a branch. He sat on the branch and bounced up and
                                    down. Then he vomited and his belly loosened. Every time he ate,
                                    he would go on this tree, then bounce up and down. He did this
                                    all of the time, so the tree was like his toilet. He always
                                    bounced and vomited his food to loosen his belly. When he
                                    worked, it was not the same as us who stand up to work. He
                                    always worked sitting. When Ripes [Repes] wanted to cut grasses
                                    or wild sugarcanes (pitpit), he shoved his legs under the
                                    grasses or wild sugarcanes. He would cut his legs with the grass
                                    or wild sugarcane and be in great pain and shout, “Amooe\”,
                                    meaning “I mourn for myself!” He cut his legs many times and his
                                    legs were filled with sores. He used big animals, such as
                                    cassowaries and pythons, as firewood. He ate bananas only when
                                    they were ripe. Some kinds of foods that are normally eaten
                                    cooked, he would eat before they were done. He made his house
                                    using a stone axe and traditional salt. One day, his maternal
                                    relative, named Muripumb, saw him. Muribumb [Muripumb] went to a
                                    mountain and heard his maternal relative’s shouting in the
                                    garden. He went quietly and arrived at his relative’s house. He
                                    looked inside the kitchen and saw <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> meat and python meat and
                                    other kinds of meat from big animals on the fire. He thought
                                    hard. He thought, “What kind of man is this?” He removed all of
                                    the meat from the fire, heated some stones and cooked all of the
                                    meat in an earth oven using the stones. After this, he destroyed
                                    his relative’s house and made a new house for Repes. When he was
                                    done, Muripumb found Repes’ toilet. He followed a small trail
                                    and arrived at the tree. He looked at the tree and thought,
                                    “This is my relative’s toilet.” He cut a komb tree and sharpened
                                    two branches well. He stood one up in front and one in back.
                                    After he finished, he went to his relative’s garden. Muripumb
                                    went quietly to the garden, hid by the base of a tree and
                                    watched. Repres [Repes] shoved his legs beneath the grasses and
                                    wild sugarcanes. He cut his legs and shouted, “Amooe." Murpumb
                                    [Muripumb] said, “What are you doing?” Repes was a little
                                    ashamed and said, “Hello, kinsman.” Muripumb said, “Give me your
                                    knife first.” He gave it to him. Then he said, “Repes, look at
                                    me, OK?” So, Muripumb stood and shoved a stick underneath the
                                    grass and cut the grass. He said, “Do you see this? Now you
                                    should do this work like me.” Repes said, “Yes, kinsman, I
                                    understand.” After he finished, Muripumb told Repres that he had
                                    cooked some food in an earth oven at the house, and that they
                                    should uncover the oven and eat. They went to eat. They
                                    uncovered the earth oven and Repres said, “Oh my, what did you
                                    cook? You cooked my firewood, huh?” Muripumb said, “Try to eat a
                                    piece of meat.” He took a piece of meat and ate it. “Man-oh-man,
                                    that’s my firewood, but it tastes delicious,” Repes said. They
                                    ate and ate, then Repres said, “I’ve had enough.” Muripumb said,
                                    “No, we must finish this food that I cooked.” They finished and
                                    their bellies were bloated. Repes got up and went to his tree to
                                    loosen his gut. He sat on top of the branch, then bounced up and
                                    down. When he bounced, the two sticks pierced his loins. He
                                    shouted, “Eyive!” meaning, “I’ve been badly injured!” Muripumb
                                    said, “Amnei i ya i komb pu komb” This means, “Kinsman, I opened
                                    your shit and piss holes.” If Muripumb had not opened Muripumb’s
                                    anus and urethra, we people of the Southern Highlands Province
                                    would not be able to defecate or urinate. This man opened these
                                    holes for all people. The two men went inside a cave. All of the
                                    people of Southern Highlands Province honor these two men at
                                    their cave and say to them, “Open our shit and piss holes.” They
                                    often take a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> and go to this cave. Now still, they honor these two men
                                    at this cave. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> that often ate in a garden. One
                                    time a father told his child, “Tomorrow evening, you and I will
                                    go watch for the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> in the garden.” So in the evening at about half past six
                                    o’clock, they walked toward the garden. When they approached the
                                    garden, the father told the child, “If you see the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> coming, you
                                    must stand and hide. I’ll try to shoot the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> .” After
                                    the father said this, they walked inside the garden. They stood
                                    for a little while, then they heard a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> making a noise in the forest
                                    and coming towards them. Quickly, the father hid his child at
                                    the base of a banana plant and covered his child with banana
                                    leaves. He stood and watched for the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> . When the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> came to a
                                    clearing, he quickly said to his child, “Child, stand and look
                                    at me when I shoot at the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> . If I shoot at the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> and the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> kills
                                    me, that’s OK. You can go back and tell mama.” He left the child
                                    and took a bamboo arrow with his bow. He pulled back hard on the
                                    bow and shot straight at the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> . Oh my! The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> just turned
                                    and broke the arrow, then ran straight at the man. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> gored the
                                    man and killed him. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          pig </span> went back home. When the child saw this, he
                                    turned into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> and flew after the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> . The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> flew and flew until the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> went into a
                                    tree hole. When the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> went into the hole, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> perched at the entrance to the
                                    hole. Then the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> turned into a boy again and went home. He walked and
                                    walked. When he came close to his village, he began to cry. He
                                    told his mother and they both cried. In the morning, the people
                                    came to gather and mourn. Everyone brought their spears, axes,
                                    stones, fire, bows, and other things to the place where the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span>
                                    lived. When they arrived at the place where the boy had seen the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> , the
                                    boy spoke to them and they began to cut the tree where the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> lived. They
                                    cut the tree until it fell over, then they cut it into little
                                    pieces. After they cut the tree, one man cut more pieces and the
                                    others watched. After much cutting, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> came forth
                                    and they beat it with axes. Later they made a big fire and
                                    cooked the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span>
                                    . After they cooked the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          pig </span> , they went home. </p>

                              <p> Once there lived a man with his wife and child. They went to their
                                    garden to dig up yams (manti'). When they arrived at the garden,
                                    the man began to dig up yams. In the evening, they finished one
                                    area. He told his family, “You can go home and I’ll sleep in the
                                    garden.” So, they left and he slept. Late at night, a huge
                                    python smelled the man and went to the garden hut where he
                                    slept. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> entered and tried to wake the man to see if he was
                                    sleeping or dead. When the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> poked the man’s head, he
                                    belched. When the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> poked the man’s buttocks, he broke wind. So, the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> went down
                                    to the stream and ate some <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> ’s leaves that are poisonous.
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    returned and poked the man again. The man did not feel anything
                                    that the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    did because he was in a deep slumber. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> tried to
                                    knock the man again on the head and buttocks. The man did not
                                    make a sound. So, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          snake </span> rested at the man’s head, then opened a net
                                    bag, put the man in it and brought him outside. Afterwards, the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    swallowed the man. The man thought that he was sleeping in his
                                    bed. He wanted to turn and sleep on another side, but the man
                                    could not turn. He wanted to turn his hands and legs but they
                                    were bound by the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake
                                    </span> ’s belly. The man thought, “Oh, I’m sleeping in a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s
                                    belly.” The man felt around his body and felt the stick that he
                                    had used to remove yams. It was hanging from his armlet. He took
                                    the stick, called boge in my language, and cut the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s belly.
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> felt
                                    a great pain and went into the stream. The man cut the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> ’s belly,
                                    then came outside and swam in the masalai’s stream. He swam and
                                    arrived at the source of the stream, then he went to his garden
                                    and slept in the middle of the yam field. In the morning, they
                                    went to look for him and saw him near the source of the stream.
                                    They saw the python’s body. So, the people do not like to sleep
                                    in the garden hut near the masalai place. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was a woman with her ten children who lived
                                    in a garden hut amidst the deep forest. One time, a woman from
                                    another place came and made a garden in the same forest in which
                                    the woman with her ten children lived. While the woman was
                                    making the garden, a masalai man came who killed and ate her.
                                    The poor woman was pregnant, so when the masalai ate her, the
                                    fetus fell to the ground, went underneath a big tree leaf and
                                    slept. On the same day, the woman with ten children was walking
                                    around. She came and saw the forest where the other woman had
                                    been making a garden. She saw the blood and looked around. She
                                    was surprised to see something underneath a tree leaf. She saw
                                    that it was a baby boy. The old woman was happy, so she took the
                                    baby and brought him to her house. When she arrived at her
                                    house, she told her ten children to prepare everything in the
                                    house for her, such as firewood, food and water. The children
                                    prepared these things and fixed up the house. She told her
                                    children to leave the house and go far away. She alone would
                                    stay and take care of the baby in the house. When it was sunny,
                                    she often went outside and taught the child. She worked at
                                    teaching him, and he grew to become a man. A very long time
                                    passed. The ten children thought, “It’s been a long time since
                                    mama began taking care of that baby and kicked us out of the
                                    house. We’ve lived here a long time now. We should try to hide
                                    and spy on her.” When they went to look, there was a big boy who
                                    was living with her. The ten children called out together and
                                    ran inside the house. They were very happy to see their brother.
                                    They lived, worked and played together all of the time. When the
                                    last boy became big, about twenty years’ old, there was a big
                                    festival about to happen near the shore. The poor old woman
                                    worked hard to make fineries for the festival, such as “grass”
                                    skirts for the women and hand drums and spears for the men. For
                                    the last boy, she made a special hand drum, spear and loincloth,
                                    and she gave him two <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> bones. After everything appeared to be
                                    ready, they waited for the time of the festival to arrive. The
                                    ten children dressed up and the old woman helped them dress the
                                    last boy. She told him, “You should stay behind, and then you
                                    should go. Your ten brothers and sisters should go first, then
                                    you should follow them. After the festival has begun, then you
                                    should go.” After the ten children left, she adorned the last
                                    son well. She put on green, yellow and black paint on his face.
                                    She gave him a hand drum, a spear, and two <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> bones
                                    that she put through his [nose]. After she finished adorning the
                                    boy, she instructed him, “When you go to the festival, you can’t
                                    go inside or among the other dancers. When you sing and dance
                                    and hit your drum, you must do it in a separate area. Before it
                                    is dawn, you must leave the festival grounds and hit your hand
                                    drum as you follow the trail to the beach. If two young women
                                    follow you and call for you, you can’t stop. You must go and sit
                                    on the beach near a big ironwood tree. Hit your hand drum and
                                    sit down. If the two young women go down to bathe and call out
                                    for you to bathe, you can’t bathe with them. If they ask why,
                                    then get up and hit the ironwood tree with this piece of <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> bone,
                                    then go inside. Just leave your face there, giving enough time
                                    for the two women to find you. Then you can disappear.” After
                                    the old woman finished her instructions, the boy walked towards
                                    the festival. When he arrived, the singing and dancing had
                                    started, so he just sang and danced. When he hit his hand drum,
                                    every man, woman and child were envious for the sound of his
                                    hand drum. They saw his face and talked, “We wish that dawn were
                                    here so that we can see this man.” Before it was light, the man
                                    followed the trail to the beach. He hit his hand drum while two
                                    beautiful young women followed him. They arrived at the beach
                                    and the women went down to bathe. He sat on the beach and sang.
                                    The two women were burning with desire for him. He did not go
                                    down to bathe with them, so they told him, “You worthless
                                    bumpkin, don’t you bathe in the sea?” This made him ashamed so
                                    he got up and hit the ironwood tree with a piece of <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> bone,
                                    then went inside. The women watched and followed him. One woman
                                    saw him and called out to the other. They ran after him and
                                    tried to hold him. But they could not catch him, so they kept
                                    running after him. He went up and turned into a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> of
                                    paradise and called out, “Kokk kokk,” and flew to another tree.
                                    So now you can see that birds of paradise have green, black and
                                    yellow on their heads. They also have a hand drum and spear [on
                                    the national emblem]. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, many people lived in a village named Ipaiva [Southern
                                    Highlands Province?]. However, these people were not good
                                    people, they often did various bad things. Among this group of
                                    people were one good man and woman and their child. They never
                                    did bad things to the other people. One day, they said, “Let’s
                                    go to the stream and look for <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> .” So, they went to the stream
                                    and fished. They saw a big <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> that was like a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> . The
                                    nice man said, “Let’s not kill it. If we kill it, a big flood
                                    will come here and all of us will die.” However, the bad men
                                    said, “You’re lying. This is not God or a masalai that will
                                    cause us to die. No, it’s just a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> .” So, they killed the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> and took
                                    it to the village to eat. The nice man dreamt at night that a
                                    man told him, “Don’t eat that <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> . I’ll kill whoever eats that
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> .”
                                    So, this man did not eat the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> . After they ate, they cooked
                                    the medicinal part of the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> that comes from its innards.
                                    This medicine spilled onto the fire and caused a deep black
                                    smoke to rise into the sky, causing a heavy rain to fall. The
                                    nice people knew that a rain would fall, so they took two
                                    chickens, a cock and a hen, two pigs, two dogs, their daughter
                                    and some fire. They climbed a coconut palm. When the flood came
                                    high, the coconut palm rose high in the sky. While they were on
                                    top of the coconut, they did not know about the state of the
                                    water. They broke off a new coconut and threw it down to the
                                    water. They did this three times, then the fourth time, they
                                    broke another young coconut, threw it and it hit the ground.
                                    They knew that the flood had finished, so they left the coconut
                                    palm and descended to the ground. All of the people and animals
                                    on the ground had died; the flood had killed them. Now, we live
                                    here. We have descended from these two people. And the animals
                                    also [came from these survivors], </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, the ghosts often lived at the source of a stream.
                                    At this time, they did not know about eating meat from wild
                                    game. No, they just ate the fur and threw away the meat into the
                                    stream. One woman took this meat all of the time. Later, she
                                    thought hard and she wanted to see what it was that was killing
                                    the game. So one morning, the woman woke up and followed the
                                    stream up and up. She saw that the ground was broken and jagged.
                                    She saw many entangled vines like a sword-grass house. The woman
                                    worked hard to keep going upstream. She saw something there.
                                    Much later, she arrived at the tangled vines and saw an old
                                    woman. She went inside. The old woman was shocked and asked
                                    sternly, “Why did you come and what do you want?” The woman told
                                    her that she often saw bandicoots and other marsupials (kapul)
                                    carried by the stream. She asked, “Can I stay with you people
                                    and teach you how to eat the meat of wild game?” The old woman
                                    said, “Oh my, I have seven children. If you speak, they’ll come
                                    and scold me. So, I don’t want you to stay.” They continued to
                                    talk, and the boys arrived. They saw the woman and were very
                                    happy. They asked her why she had come. The woman was happy too
                                    and she told them her story. So, the first brother married her.
                                    Later, they had a baby boy. One day, the fathers [father and
                                    uncles] went to the forest to hunt for food and wild game. After
                                    they had left for the forest, the little boy made a ditch. As
                                    the sun was setting, a little rain fell. The rain went into the
                                    ditch and directly towards the house. The boy’s mother scolded
                                    him badly, saying, “Oh my! Your fathers are just ghosts. They’re
                                    ignorant, so they made the house in a bad location. Why did you
                                    make a ditch that caused the water to come and wreck the house?”
                                    The woman said this at home, but the ghosts heard her in the
                                    forest. They were irate and decided to leave the woman and flee.
                                    In the early morning, the six brothers and the old woman turned
                                    into birds and flew away. The father carried the child and went
                                    upwards. The woman woke up and cried out. The child heard her
                                    and told his father, “Papa, I think mother is calling and
                                    following us.” But the father said, “No, it’s a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> calling.”
                                    The father and son continued climbing a tall mountain called
                                    Mount Sarowaga [Saruwaged Mountains, Morobe Province?]. The
                                    mother stood on a short mountain called Sarowaga’s Wife. At this
                                    time, the father put the boy down and said, “Son, you love your
                                    mother too much. OK, stay here and when your mother finds you,
                                    look for the trail and leave. Otherwise, you two stay here. The
                                    sun will see you in the early morning at about five o’clock. It
                                    will see you first, then later it will see me.” The poor father
                                    said this, then departed. He turned into a stream that we call
                                    Magi which flows down Mount Sarowaga. The mother took the child,
                                    and the father left them and went straight to the sea. The
                                    mother carried the child and found the trail, but it was
                                    entirely impassable. So the mother turned into a black stone. On
                                    top of the stone the child turned into a red fig, called wifu in
                                    my language. You who live near Sarowaga, look at this story. I
                                    think that it is correct. You will worry just a little. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was no moon in the sky. This is the story of the
                                    moon from the Aitape area. There was a village named Malol
                                    [Sissano People, West Sepik Province]. In this village, there
                                    lived a man and his wife. They lived there and raised only two
                                    children. The first child was a boy and the second was a girl.
                                    One night, they did not have food for themselves. The father and
                                    mother told the two children, “You two stay here and we’ll go
                                    find <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> in
                                    the stream. We’ll bring sago and other food.” The two children
                                    agreed. The father and mother went to the stream. This place had
                                    a land masalai that lived in the area. When the parents
                                    returned, they had not fooled around with fishing. They had
                                    “stolen” a lot. The two of them cooked the food. The man told
                                    his wife, “Don’t call the children, leave them alone. They’re
                                    sleeping and we can finish this food. When they ask you in the
                                    morning for food, say, ‘We didn’t get any <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . We came
                                    home empty-handed.’” The boy heard their parents talking. When
                                    dawn arrived, the little boy woke his sister and said, “We must
                                    leave our parents.” The sister agreed. They got up and went down
                                    [through the window] and arrived at the area of the land
                                    masalai. They asked the masalai to help them. The land masalai
                                    asked them what they wanted. The land masalai turned them
                                    yellow. The little boy asked the masalai why it did this. The
                                    masalai told them, “To give you light.” They said “Yes” to the
                                    masalai. So when you want to look at the moon and you see
                                    something black, it is the little boy and his sister. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago there were families who lived on top of a mountain
                                    called Aseonka in the Kainantu area [Agarabi People, Eastern
                                    Highlands Province], These families only ate sweet potatoes and
                                    taros. They never ate them with meat. One time, the father
                                    angrily said, “Why is that that we only eat sweet potatoes with
                                    taros everyday.” He said that the next day, he would take his
                                    son and they would hunt for wild game, then eat it with taros
                                    and sweet potatoes. The father woke up in the early morning and
                                    began to cook some sweet potatoes to carry into the forest. Dawn
                                    arrived. He put the sweet potatoes in a small net bag and took
                                    his bow and arrows. At about six o’clock in the morning, he woke
                                    his son and they began to walk into the forest. They walked and
                                    walked. In the middle of the forest, the son became very hungry
                                    and ate some sweet potato. The father turned back and saw the
                                    boy eating. He said, “Son, stop eating. We have not arrived in
                                    the deep forest yet.” However, the boy was hungry, so he
                                    finished eating. They kept walking and arrived at the [deep]
                                    forest. The father sat under a tree and told the boy, “I’m
                                    hungry now. Get some of the sweet potatoes that we cooked and
                                    brought here. We’ll eat first, then go hunt for wild game.” The
                                    boy told his father that the he had finished the food on the
                                    trail. The father asked him again. He asked whether he was
                                    telling the truth or just fibbing. The boy was telling the
                                    truth. When the father heard this, he became irate. He told the
                                    boy, “Boy, you must stay here and I’ll go shake that tree. When
                                    I return to the forest, I’ll have killed many marsupials (kaput)
                                    at that tree.” The boy said he would stay there. However, the
                                    father tricked his son and quickly ran back home. The child
                                    waited and waited for his father, but his father did not return
                                    quickly. He called out, “Papa! Papa!” But his father did not
                                    reply. He called out again, “Papa! Papa!” But the boy’s voice
                                    “missed”, and he became a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cockatoo </span> . Now if you see a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cockatoo </span> and
                                    say, “Hello <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cockatoo
                                    </span> ,” the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cockatoo
                                    </span> will say “Hello” to you. This is because that boy became
                                    a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cockatoo </span> .
                                    However, men cannot do this, so they cut a tanget and plant it.

                              <p> In the time of yore, a brother and sister lived in a village named
                                    Kwipage Nokiake [Madang Province?]. The brother’s name was
                                    Perkagel, and the sister’s name was Direduruagele. One day, the
                                    brother told his sister Direduruagele, “You and I always stay
                                    home, that’s bad. When the sun rises, it would be better if you
                                    dig some sweet potatoes in the garden and prepare them. Then you
                                    and I shall go to the forest to hunt for some wild game for
                                    ourselves.” So, the sister went to the garden and took the good
                                    sweet potatoes from the garden. The brother, Perkagel, sharpened
                                    his arrows and his multi-pronged spear, and he tightened his
                                    bow. Things were ready, so the next morning they woke up and
                                    went to the forest. When they arrived at a place to sleep, the
                                    brother told his sister, “Stay here and make a fire, clean off a
                                    place to sleep, and prepare some food for us. I’m going to the
                                    forest to hunt for some wild game for us tonight.” When he was
                                    ready to go, he told his sister, “Please, don’t 142 travel
                                    around the area. You must just stay in the hut here.” The
                                    brother went to the forest, and the sister stayed. She tired of
                                    staying at the hut, so she went a little ways away and found a
                                    good vine for making a net bag. While she was taking the vine,
                                    she heard a man hitting a hand drum, singing and coming toward
                                    her. He was dressed beautifully, his name was Digindagan. He
                                    told the woman, “Get your net bag and come here.” The man was
                                    filled with adornments, and he had decorations of many colors
                                    inside his net bag. When the woman saw this, she was startled.
                                    Her heart jumped and she nearly wanted to go with him.
                                    Digindagan made an offer to her, then he got up, hit the hand
                                    drum, sang and departed. The woman got up and went to the hut to
                                    stay. When the brother returned, the sister was crying. She did
                                    not eat. The brother gave her some marsupial (kaput) meat, and
                                    he too did not eat. She was still crying, so the brother said,
                                    “Now I know. I told you that you couldn’t go outside the hut.
                                    You should have just stayed at the hut, but you ignored what I
                                    said and you saw Digindagan. OK, finish crying and eat, then you
                                    can go to him.” The woman finished crying, then she ate. In the
                                    morning, they went back home. The brother cut firewood and
                                    gathered stones. He took a huge <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> , then killed and cooked it [in
                                    an earth oven]. After the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> was done, he removed it [from
                                    the oven] and butchered it. He decorated his sister very nicely:
                                    a pretty “grass” skirt, bracelets, necklaces, beautiful <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> feathers
                                    for her hair, and many marsupial furs. After he finished, he
                                    took the pork ribs, put much salt on them and gave them to his
                                    sister. When the sister held them, a bolt of lightning flashed,
                                    then rain came and took the woman away. Now, we often send women
                                    away to be married. It is the fault of this woman, Direduruagle
                                    [Direduruagele], because she ignored her brother. At first, we
                                    often worry when our sisters leave us and go with a new man.

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was an old woman with her young son. At this
                                    time, they did not work in the garden. They lived together until
                                    the boy married a young woman from another village. They then
                                    lived together and had four children. The man, his wife and
                                    their four children did not look after the man’s old mother. No,
                                    the poor old woman often went to sleep hungry. One time, the man
                                    went to the forest to build a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> blind. Then he watched from
                                    the blind. While he was watching, his old mother was approaching
                                    death at her home. While she slept in her bed, her spirit became
                                    a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> and
                                    followed her son into the forest. She approached the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> blind and
                                    ate tree [fruits] near her son’s <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> blind. When her son saw her,
                                    he thought that it was a real <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> , so he quickly shot her.
                                    When the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> was approaching death, she spoke as a person would, “You
                                    killed me. You can’t eat me. You must cut a tree on top of me,
                                    then go home. Stay there for one or two months, then return.
                                    When you see something growing on top of the place that I am
                                    lying, you must take care of it. It’s food for you.” The man
                                    heeded this and did as his mother’s spirit told him to do. After
                                    two months, he went and saw a new thing growing on top of the
                                    place where his mother’s spirit rested. He looked at it and he
                                    took care of it. Later, the man tried eating it and it was
                                    delicious. So, they took care of it and planted it. This is the
                                    beginning of gardening. They planted these yams, took care of
                                    them and they were prolific. So now in Nuku, we often plant yams
                                    [Mehek People, West Sepik Province]. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, there was a huge <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> snake </span> named Kaiwaru that lived up
                                    in the sky. This was a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          snake </span> that ate people, pigs, dogs and other things
                                    on the earth. Every day, Kaiwaru came straight down from above
                                    to kill people, then went back up to eat them. Kaiwaru did this
                                    for a long time until there were no people anywhere except for
                                    just one woman. This young woman fled to the forest and went
                                    inside a cave. She lived there and gave birth to a baby flying
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> . The
                                    woman was irate and wanted to kill the flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> , but she
                                    was surprised to hear a small voice say, “Don’t kill me, I’ll
                                    help you mother. Let me stay with you.” As the flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> grew, it
                                    often flew and went down to find food for itself and its mother.
                                    They lived for a while, then the mother gave birth to a baby
                                    boy. The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox
                                    </span> was ecstatic. The flying <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> worked hard to find water, food
                                    and firewood for the mother and boy. The flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> also
                                    watched carefully for Kaiwaru. It would be bad if Kaiwaru found
                                    them and ate them. One morning, the flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> flew very
                                    far to find food. The mother and baby were hungry, so the baby
                                    cried very loudly and incessantly. Kaiwaru heard the crying, and
                                    so the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span>
                                    came down and said, “Who’s that? This place doesn’t have any
                                    people, or maybe there’s a person hiding in a hole for me.”
                                    Kaiwaru laughed loudly and went down to earth. The woman was
                                    surprised to look outside the cave. No, it was the huge head of
                                    Kaiwaru making a noise at the entrance. The woman knew that
                                    Kaiwaru would kill her and her son, so she began to cry and sing
                                    a song of mourning. The flying <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> heard this singing, “Come
                                    quickly, come quickly home, flying- <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> child.” So, the flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> sped back
                                    to the cave. The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          fox </span> looked at the cave, but there was no one
                                    there. The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox
                                    </span> went to what was a village, but no one was there either.
                                    The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span>
                                    looked up and saw its mother and brother hanging. The flying
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> left
                                    the food behind, took a stone axe and flew upwards. The flying
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span>
                                    missed its mother and brother, then went to the middle of
                                    Kaiwaru and began to cut. The flying <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> cut the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> into two
                                    pieces, which fell to the ground. Its mother and brother were
                                    all right now. The flying <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fox </span> cut the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> snake </span> into many
                                    small pieces. The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > fox </span> threw the head into the forest. Kaiwaru’s
                                    head became all of the kinds of snakes that we see on the
                                    ground. The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox
                                    </span> threw some pieces of Kaiwaru into the sea and these
                                    became eels, lizards, octopuses, sea snakes and other things.
                                    The flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span>
                                    threw Kaiwaru’s blood into the sea and this became red <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . Now you
                                    can see many red <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> in the sea. Later, when the flying <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fox </span> finished,
                                    it looked at its mother and brother. It left them at the village
                                    and went back to the cave where it grew up. Kaiwaru was dead and
                                    the mother and boy lived well. Now, we can see flying foxes that
                                    live in caves. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, my ancestors from Ablingi Island had fishing nets
                                    [Gasmata People, West New Britain Province]. If they wanted to
                                    have a big party or feast, they would always go get some <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . They
                                    fished at night, in the morning or in the afternoon. Every time
                                    they did this, they would <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> with nets. One night, they
                                    went to get their nets for fishing. They took their canoes and
                                    paddled to an island. They came approached the island and put
                                    their nets in the sea. This island is named Arili. They began to
                                    chase the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span>
                                    into the nets and were surprised to see a big light falling from
                                    the sky. It was as if a star was falling into the sea, straight
                                    into their nets. They ran towards it like it was a big <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> and held
                                    it in the net. The men jumped on top of the star. They held it
                                    tightly and looked closely to see whether it was a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> or a star.
                                    It was a big stone. They took the rock with the net and put it
                                    at the bow of the canoe. They began to be afraid, so they
                                    trembled and thought that it was a masalai that was making them
                                    afraid and argumentative. Their thinking was confused, so they
                                    questioned each other. Some said that it was a stone from the
                                    sky and some said, “It’s not a stone. It’s probably a masalai or
                                    an ancestral spirit.” They became afraid of the stone and no one
                                    approached it. They went home and brought the stone to their
                                    village. They woke up everyone and told everyone to come look at
                                    what they had brought. The people came and looked at the big
                                    stone that was placed in the middle of the village. Another clan
                                    asked them, “Why did you take this stone? Did you think that it
                                    was a masalai or an ancestral spirit?” No, they said, this was a
                                    stone and it had fallen from the sky, it was lit like a star,
                                    and it had fallen into their net like a big <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . So, they
                                    all carried the stone and put it near the village. In the
                                    morning, they sent the women to get taros from the garden. They
                                    made a big feast for the stone. Today, you can still see this
                                    stone. We boys grew up looking at this stone. Today we put the
                                    stone under our church gable. If you come to Ablingi, you will
                                    see this stone. </p>

                                    had a short tail and lived in the forest. Modaged had a long
                                    tail and lived in a village and did not like to go in the forest
                                    much. Modaged was a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          bird </span> that flew around villages and hunted for
                                    feces. It went inside latrines and under houses. It dug and ate
                                    the feces and some trash too. Gerail wanted to grow up as a
                                    clean <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> of
                                    the forest. One time, Gerail went to the village. Near the
                                    village was a big tree. Gerail went to the top of this tree,
                                    perched and watched Modaged’s tail. Gerail worried a lot that
                                    its tail was not nice and long. Gerail knew that it would be
                                    ruined on the feces and on the ground too. Gerail sat and sat.
                                    Gerail thought hard. Then Gerail said, “Never mind. I’ll try and
                                    ask my friend if we can quickly exchange tails.” Quickly, the
                                    short-tailed <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> jumped in front of its friend Modaged, and said, “Can we
                                    exchange tails or not? I saw yours, but aren’t you a little
                                    straight?” Modaged replied, “Why, Gerail? You have a nice tail,
                                    but you often throw it around on the ground. On the other hand,
                                    I have a bad tail though I take care of it well.” Modaged told
                                    his friend, “I think this is true because I’m not a
                                    forest-dwelling <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> . I’m just a village-dwelling <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> . We must exchange tails
                                    quickly. Take mine and save it well on the tree. You must come
                                    to me and throw your tail around the village.” They exchanged
                                    tails. So now you see a kind of <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> that is in the forest with a
                                    long tail. If you go to New Guinea, you will see many men who
                                    shoot this kind of <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> with guns and make head decorations from their feathers
                                    for use in festivals [probably a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> of paradise]. If you look at
                                    another kind of <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> that lives in villages, it has a short tail. This <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> goes
                                    around latrines and under houses. It digs feces and eats them.
                                    The feathers of both birds are black. </p>

                              <p> Once, there was a little boy who took his bow and arrows and
                                    followed a stream to hunt for <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> crayfish </span> and eels. As he went
                                    along, he saw a huge tulip tree’s shadow in the water. The tulip
                                    tree was ruined, and so the little boy went to get some tulip
                                    leaves [to eat]. He went to defecate at the base of the tree,
                                    then he climbed the tree. While he was still gathering the
                                    leaves, a masalai woman was following the stream. The masalai
                                    woman smelled the little boy’s feces, so she looked up into the
                                    forest and saw the little boy on top of the tulip tree. The
                                    masalai woman climbed the tree and told the little boy, “Little
                                    boy, go along this small branch to get some tulip leaves.” But
                                    the little boy was afraid to go along the small branch. The
                                    masalai woman tricked the boy and he fell. Later, the masalai
                                    woman put the little boy into many net bags, about nine or ten.
                                    The masalai woman ate the little boy’s feces. She covered up a
                                    piece of excrement and carried it to her husband. Her husband
                                    was sharpening his arrows and tightening his spear. The masalai
                                    woman went and looked at her husband. She took the bow in her
                                    hand, broke it and threw it away. The masalai woman told her
                                    husband, “You’re just working on your bow and arrows. You never
                                    go to find wild game.” After she said this, she threw the
                                    covered excrement at her husband and said, “Where do you hunt?
                                    You left this shit that was covered and eaten.” Her husband
                                    immediately uncovered the excrement and began to eat the little
                                    boys’ feces. The masalai woman had hung up the poor little boy
                                    in their house. The married couple went to find some bananas and
                                    other food to cook with the little boy. After they departed, the
                                    little boy put his hand on his loincloth and felt a kina shell.
                                    He took this kina shell and began to cut the net bags. The old
                                    mother of the married couple saw this and called out, “Hey, what
                                    are you doing? It would be bad if you fell. Just go to sleep.”
                                    The married couple went to the garden to get some bananas. [The
                                    old woman said,] “We’ll cook and eat first, then later you’ll go
                                    back to your village.” However, the little boy kept cutting the
                                    net bags and he fell down. He took a yam (mami) and hit the old
                                    woman in the guts, killing her. The boy got up and ran home.
                                    When the married couple returned to the house, they did not see
                                    their old mother. The masalai woman got up and checked the
                                    trailhead. She smelled or sensed the boy going along the trail,
                                    so she followed him and went towards the little boy’s village.
                                    When the little boy arrived home, he spoke to his parents and
                                    the other people of the village. After he told them his story,
                                    all of the men of the village prepared to kill the masalai
                                    woman. When the masalai woman arrived at the village, she asked
                                    the people, “Hey did you see a crazy boy come here or not?” The
                                    masalai woman lied and said, “Yesterday, I took a little boy to
                                    my house and he just slept. In the morning, my husband and I
                                    went to the garden to find some bananas to cook and eat. But the
                                    crazy boy got up and ran away, so I came to get him and return.
                                    When the masalai woman tried hard to get the boy, the boy’s
                                    father shot the masalai woman dead. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, in my village, Tigina, there was an ancestor named
                                    Tiginakuo Tulagu Yea. He was like a real man, but he was a
                                    masalai. Tiginakuo had a boy named Pokuka. He and his son did
                                    not have a garden, so they often stole food from other gardens.
                                    One time, it rained and rained, and they were very hungry. At
                                    this time, Tiginakuo told his son, “Let’s travel around and find
                                    some food.” He brought his son and they left. They walked and
                                    walked. After about fifteen miles, they arrived at a garden.
                                    They rested and saw some bananas. They wanted to get the
                                    bananas, so Tiginakuo took his axe and cut the bananas. Later,
                                    they took the bananas and carried them along the trail. After a
                                    little while, the garden’s owner arrived. He was shocked to see
                                    that his bananas were gone. He was very angry. Later, he saw
                                    their footprints, but they had already returned to their home.
                                    When they arrived at their house, Tiginakuo told his son, “Son,
                                    you must sit and watch for men. I’ll cook the bananas in the
                                    fire.” His son, Pokuka, sat on a stone and watched. As he was
                                    watching, his eyes closed and he slept a little, forgetting
                                    about watching. After a little while, the owner of the garden
                                    saw the smoke from the fire. He pulled out his axe and walked
                                    quietly towards the house. He looked inside the house and saw
                                    Tiginakuo sitting and cooking the bananas on the fire. He stood
                                    up and said, “Tiginakuo.” When Tiginakuo turned and saw the
                                    owner of the garden, he was surprised. When Tiginakuo called out
                                    to Pokuka, the owner of the garden put his axe right through his
                                    back. As he was dying, he said, “Pokuka, son, you ran away and
                                    I’m dying now.” Then Tiginakuo’s head went forward to a cave and
                                    he died. When Pokuka heard his father calling out, he jumped and
                                    ran away. However, when he jumped down, he was no longer a boy.
                                    No, Pokuka turned into a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"
                                          > bird </span> and flew towards the big stone called Tulu
                                    in the deep forest. Now, he lives at a stone that we call
                                    Homainige. I am from Tiginakuo’s little village in Madang
                                    Province [Gende People]. </p>

                              <p> Once, long ago, a man from Wilbeite Village and his two children
                                    went to a mountain far away from his village to hunt wild game
                                    [Olo People, West Sepik Province]. They took bows, arrows, food
                                    and a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> with
                                    them. They arrived at a mountain hut and the father told his
                                    children, “You two stay in the hut. Just myself and the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> will go
                                    into the forest to hunt for marsupials (sikau)'' The children
                                    made a fire and stayed in the hut. They joked and laughed. The
                                    sister told her brother, “You stay here. I’m going to find some
                                    vegetables.” When the sister returned from finding vegetables,
                                    her brother got up to find some firewood. He cut and cut the
                                    firewood. While he was cutting, he heard a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> barking and
                                    chasing a marsupial. He stood up and saw a marsupial running
                                    towards him. He killed it and his father killed another. The
                                    sister was alone in the hut and thought of the things left at
                                    home, such as ropes, yams, bananas, and bamboo tubes. She
                                    thought of these things and spoke to herself, “Oh please, I’d
                                    like those things very much. Who will bring those things here to
                                    me?” As she spoke, those things just appeared before her eyes.
                                    Right after the things arrived, all of the things in the forest
                                    transformed themselves. The place became pitch black. The
                                    insects in the forest chirped and sang, and it became very
                                    noisy. Soon, a big flood arose from the ground. When the father
                                    saw the transformations, he asked his two children, “Which one
                                    of you spoke when these things changed?” The brother told his
                                    father, “It was sister who spoke when these bad things
                                    happened.” The water was rising quickly. The father noticed
                                    this, so he quickly took a long piece of rattan and used it for
                                    them to climb a tall tree. However, a big masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> shot the
                                    girl [with a jet of water?] and carried her down into the water.
                                    The father cut the girl’s pinkie finger and gave it to the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> to carry
                                    home. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    jumped down to the ground and went home. When the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> arrived
                                    home, the girl’s mother was stirring sago. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> threw the
                                    finger into the dish of sago. The mother saw this and thought
                                    that something bad had happened to her two children and her
                                    husband on the mountain. Now, because of this, if we go on top
                                    of this mountain, we can see yams and bamboo growing near this
                                    pond. Also, if we go to the summit, we cannot speak, point at
                                    food or call out. We are terrified there. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, in the Finschhafen Peninsula, there was a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> and a
                                    chicken that were very good friends. One time, the friends
                                    thought about going to an island. So, they took their canoe and
                                    paddled off. The chicken sat in the bow. While they were
                                    paddling, a strong wind arose and made the chicken’s feathers
                                    dance about. Everyone saw chicken’s feathers and they gossiped.
                                    When they gossiped, they made the chicken very unhappy. However,
                                    the chicken’s friend, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> , was ashamed and very
                                    angry at the chicken. So, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> stood up and broke the
                                    canoe with its leg, then the water filled the canoe. As the
                                    water rose, the chicken flew to the beach where everyone was
                                    standing. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> was too heavy and found it too hard to <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fly </span> . So, the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    sank beneath the water where it found a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> and asked
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> for
                                    help. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span>
                                    said, “I often go above the water.” So the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> carried
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    upwards and placed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> where it wanted to go. When the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span> put the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    down, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> did not say thank you. No, the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> did something bad. It
                                    killed the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> crab </span>
                                    . So now, the people of this area call this place Oeraharuc. In
                                    English, this means, “Cassowary and Crab.” Now, there is a
                                    mission station there that is called Sattelberg, in the

                              <p> Long, long ago, the people did not have lime (calcium oxide), so
                                    they always chewed betel nut with just ashes from the fire. The
                                    women had one huge, round shell. They never put the shell
                                    outside. No, they always hid it inside a clay pot. When the men
                                    wanted to chew betel nuts, they always chewed them with ashes,
                                    but their saliva did not turn red. When they chewed betel nuts,
                                    their mouths became very yellow. When the women wanted to chew
                                    betel nuts, they usually each took a piece of sago palm midrib
                                    and the shell. Then began chewing the betel nuts. After they
                                    chewed, they went outside. The men said to them, “You women were
                                    chewing betel nuts with something and now your mouths are very
                                    red.” The women replied, “We only chewed betel nuts with ashes
                                    and now our mouths are very red.” One time, the women went to
                                    the forest. The men hid a little boy in the house where the
                                    women chewed betel nuts. The boy’s name was Embangeba. In the
                                    evening, the women returned from the forest and went inside
                                    their house again to chew betel nuts. The boy saw them chewing
                                    betel nuts. He hid well and just watched the women. The women
                                    removed the shell from the clay pot and began to chew the betel
                                    nuts. One day, the women went to fetch some water. The boy hid
                                    and took their betel nuts, then chewed them with the women’s
                                    shell. After he chewed, his mouth became very red. When the
                                    women returned, they saw the little boy sitting there. His mouth
                                    was very red. The women saw this and thought, “The boy has
                                    ruined our shell.” The women said, “What should we do about this
                                    little boy who ruined our shell?” One day, all of the men went
                                    to hunt for wild game. The women made a big party. They quickly
                                    divided the food, they took their shell and put it in the
                                    middle. They called to the little boy, Embangeba. All of the
                                    women surrounded this boy. They took their sago palm midribs and
                                    beat the boy, killing him. Later, they told the children, “This
                                    is your father’s food plate. When he arrives, you can eat with
                                    him.” After the women spoke to the children, they pulled an “
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> eagle </span> ”
                                    betel nut and a flying <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          fox </span> bone, then hit the base of a coconut palm
                                    tree. Later, all of the women climbed this coconut palm. However
                                    one woman was pregnant, so she did not climb with the others.

                              <p> Long ago, there lived a man and his wife. The place where they
                                    lived did not have water. None. They usually just cooked their
                                    food in the fire and ate it. They did this for a long time, then
                                    the wife gave birth. The man was very worried for his wife and
                                    child. They slept and the next morning, he woke up and took his
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> to
                                    the forest to hunt for wild game. They arrived at a mountain and
                                    the man saw a fig tree. On top of the fig tree were many
                                    marsupials (kapul). The man left his <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> on the ground and he climbed
                                    the fig tree. He killed many marsupials. He thought, “If there
                                    was water, I could make a good soup for mama and baby.” He
                                    thought this and continued to kill the marsupials while singing
                                    on the tree. His <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> was walking around on the ground. Then the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> quickly dug
                                    a hole. The man went and called out to his <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> . The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> came up the
                                    hole and shook its body, splashing water on the man. The man
                                    carried the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span>
                                    and rubbed its skin. They turned and looked. No! There was water
                                    shooting to the top of the hole that the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog </span> had made.
                                    The man was very happy and went to cut a piece of bamboo to fill
                                    with water. He returned home with his <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> . The woman saw this and was
                                    very happy for her husband and their <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> . In the morning, they woke up
                                    and oh my, the water was flowing down. This place is called
                                    Kanome [Kanomi] in Sialum sub-Province, in the Finschhafen
                                    Peninsula of [Morobe] Province [Ono People]. If you go to this
                                    place, you will see many streams and think that there is a lake
                                    there. It is very high in the forest, not near the beach. This
                                    lake is where the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> dog
                                    </span> dug the hole. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> dog </span> ’s master came down from the
                                    fig tree and he tried to make other springs, but there was only
                                    one spring that could be made. The men of this place often make
                                    gardens inside the water. The people also often defecate in the
                                    water. When they want to plant taros (taro tru and taro
                                    kongkong) and bananas, they will talk in the language used in
                                    Pindiu Village and the water will go where they planted [Kube
                                    People]. The water goes back to lie in the garden. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was a man who had many small sores on his head.
                                    When he went to catch <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          fish </span> , he would put his head in the sea. Many
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> came
                                    and hung onto his sores and ate them. This man often caught many
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> this
                                    way, more than all of the other men did. He often shared his
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> with
                                    all of the men of the village. He did this for a while, then one
                                    day the men found him and saw how he caught <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> . They
                                    were very angry with him, so he was quite ashamed. He
                                    transformed his body and became a reef in the sea. So now, we
                                    can see that reefs have many little holes and spikes like sores,
                                    and that reefs are very sharp. If we walk on top of a reef, we
                                    will scratch our legs and be in pain. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, an old man and his old wife lived in Aoaveloi
                                    Village in the Gimi [People’s] area, near Okapa [Eastern
                                    Highlands Province], They had a beautiful child named Tabo. Tabo
                                    always went to the forest to hunt for marsupials (kaput). One
                                    day, he was tired of going to the forest, so he took his bow and
                                    arrows, then followed the Olaotu River upstream. In the middle
                                    of Olaotu River stood a boulder. Tabo approached the boulder and
                                    a light came over his entire body. He followed the light and saw
                                    a beautiful woman sitting on top of the boulder, making a net
                                    bag. Tabo looked up at a tree and saw a tree branch that went
                                    close to the boulder. He quietly climbed the tree and followed
                                    the branch towards the boulder. He jumped down and stood in
                                    front of the woman. The woman was surprised and wanted to run
                                    away, but Tabo held her hand tightly. The woman trembled. Tabo
                                    asked her, “Who made this bracelet and gave it to you?” The
                                    woman said, “You think that I don’t have a father, huh?” Tabo
                                    asked again, “Who made this hat and gave it to you?” The woman
                                    said, “I don’t have a mother, huh?” The boulder opened and the
                                    woman ran inside, but quickly Tabo ran inside too. The two of
                                    them killed an old man who was watching the door. Tabo did not
                                    have a way to get out, so he married the woman. The woman’s
                                    parents made a big party for them. Tabo’s parents thought that
                                    he was gone for good, so they put much mud on their bodies [a
                                    sign of mourning] and cried. After the woman’s parents gave the
                                    party, the woman’s father took a big stick and hit the stone,
                                    opening it. Tabo and his wife went outside. Tabo took the woman
                                    to his house. His parents had thought that he was gone for good,
                                    so when they saw Tabo with the woman coming, they were happy.
                                    They lived for a fairly long time, and his wife had a baby boy.
                                    Tabo left the house and his wife went to the garden, so they
                                    left the boy with his grandmother. While they were gone, the boy
                                    cried loudly. The grandmother scolded him, “You’re not the son
                                    of a man, you’re the son of a cave woman. You can’t cry.” The
                                    boy’s mother went closer to the house and heard him. The woman
                                    went there, held her boy and she took some fire. They went down
                                    to the boulder where she used to sit, and she cried. Tabo went
                                    to the house. He searched and searched for his wife. His wife
                                    was not there, so he followed her footprints and went down to
                                    see the woman sitting on top of the boulder with their son. Tabo
                                    said, “First, give me the boy.” The woman replied, “He’s not the
                                    son of a cave woman.” After she said this, the boy turned into a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> of
                                    paradise and flew towards the source of the river, then went
                                    inside a cave. Tabo cried and cried, then went back to the house
                                    and killed his mother. </p>

                              <p> This is a true story about a <span style="color: red;"

                                    (Casuarius bennetti) is the only species on New Britain Island
                                    (Beehler et al., 1986: 45)] and a masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> . Long,
                                    long ago, in the time of the great men, there was a very bad
                                    masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> .
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span>
                                    swallowed men who paddled canoes or logs that drifted in the
                                    sea. If the men of my area near Hoskins wanted to go there, no,
                                    this masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam
                                    </span> often swallowed them. The masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> did this
                                    for many years. The people of the area became fewer and fewer.
                                    One time, a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> stood on top of its home and saw a canoe coming towards
                                    Hoskins, so the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> thought that it would arrive. But no,
                                    the bad <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span>
                                    ate the canoe. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> thought and thought, something did not
                                    look right. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> was very angry. So the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    thought of a trick with which to fool the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> . The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    finished thinking and said, “OK, I’ll go try the trick on the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> .”
                                    One day, the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary
                                    </span> went down to the sea and called out to the masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> . The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    said, “Hey, friend, I always stand at my place and watch you
                                    eating a lot of food. It just makes me salivate. I often find it
                                    hard to find food. What do you think, can we change places? Come
                                    up here, and I’ll take your place and eat some meat?” The
                                    masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span>
                                    thought for five minutes then said, “That’s just fine. We can
                                    change places. Come help me, then eat some meat.” So they
                                    changed places. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          clam </span> went up and the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> cassowary </span> went to the masalai <span

                                    They stayed for a very long time. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> clam </span> saw some canoes coming from
                                    the Biala [Bialia] area and the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> clam </span> called down to the <span

                                    “Hey friend, get ready now, a canoe’s coming from Biala.” The
                                    masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span>
                                    thought that the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> would swallow the canoe. But no, the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    just let them paddle past. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> clam </span> saw this and was very angry.
                                    The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> said,
                                    “Why did you let them go? Are you blind?” The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> said,
                                    “It’s a bad thing that you always do. Before, I often saw you
                                    swallow and eat many of my men, women and children. I’m very
                                    sorry for them, so I talked to you about changing places. Now
                                    I’ll let them go.” The <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          clam </span> was very angry and wanted to go down to its
                                    home, but it was too late. The vines of the forest were growing
                                    around the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span>
                                    and holding it tightly. The <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> clam </span> could no longer move. The
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span>
                                    stayed there, then large red ants and other ants of the forest
                                    urinated in its “eyes”, and the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> clam </span> died. The <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> lived
                                    entirely in the sea. If you go to the Tarobi area in West New
                                    Britain Province, you can see this masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> shell. Its
                                    opening is about fifty feet [West Nakanai People]. Now too, if
                                    it is a good day with calm seas, you can see our friend, the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    , walking on the reef in the home of the masalai <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> clam </span> . If you
                                    take an airplane from Hoskins to Biala, you can see this, the
                                    shell of the masalai <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          clam </span> , and the big hole in the reef. I have seen
                                    the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    walking on the reef with my own eyes. The <span

                              <p> Mr. Kuri lived under Mui [Hagen] Mountain [Hagen People, Western
                                    Highlands Province], One morning, Kuri took his bow and
                                    multi-pronged arrows, then went to the forest to shoot birds
                                    that were eating tree flowers. [Pollinating flowers? The crested
                                    berrypecker (Paramythia montium) picks flowers, but does not eat
                                    them. Sunbirds (family Nectariniidae) and some honeyeaters
                                    (family Meliphagidae) drink flower nectar.] One tree had
                                    beautiful flowers, and so it had many birds eating them. Mr.
                                    Kuri watched and saw a very beautiful <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> of paradise sitting nearby.
                                    Kuri took a good shot at the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> with a multi-pronged arrow
                                    that had a hole. The beautiful <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> of paradise fell down with the
                                    arrow. When Kuri wanted to hold the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> bird </span> , it flew away. Kuri watched
                                    and saw this <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> of paradise land in Hagen Town. Kuri bit his fingers and
                                    broke his bow. He said that it would be bad if he went home to
                                    sleep. In the morning, he killed a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> and cooked it in an earth oven.
                                    He carried the pork and went to find the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird </span> of
                                    paradise. In the evening, Kuri said good-bye to his clan and
                                    walked off. He walked and walked... then arrived at a garden. In
                                    the garden, he saw a woman picking edible greens. The woman
                                    called to her daughter, “Sick daughter, which kind of cucumber
                                    do you want to eat, the big one or the small one?” The little
                                    girl replied that she felt the pain of a multi-pronged spear, so
                                    she wanted to eat the small cucumber. Kuri heard this, and was
                                    happy. He waited for the mother to leave the house first. The
                                    mother took a cucumber and some greens, then left the house.
                                    Kuri carried the pork and followed her. Near the door, the woman
                                    turned, saw Kuri and asked, “Hey, why did you come here?” [He
                                    replied,] “No, I shot a <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          bird </span> of paradise, but I came down here to look for
                                    it. It’s nearly dark, so I came to sleep with you two. Tomorrow
                                    I’ll leave.” This was the mother of the young woman who had
                                    transformed from a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> bird
                                    </span> of paradise and who Kuri had shot. So, Kuri gave the
                                    pork to the woman to eat as payment [bride price]. The woman
                                    gave her beautiful young daughter to Kuri. When they wanted to
                                    marry, the mother gave a piece of ginger root to them and
                                    blessed them, “Put this ginger in a dry place, so that you two
                                    will have many good things for yourselves.” They took it and put
                                    it in a dry place, then they slept in the men’s house. In the
                                    morning, they went to look for the place where the ginger was.
                                    The mother was not fooling around. They found a good house and
                                    garden with cassowaries, pigs, money, wild bamboo, and fine
                                    clothing. These things filled the place. They left their old
                                    place and went to sit in their new place. They lived there for a
                                    while, then the woman gave birth to a baby boy. One afternoon,
                                    the woman went down to the garden while the man took care of
                                    their son. However, the mother did not return quickly and the
                                    baby cried a lot. The father scolded this boy, “I did not buy
                                    your mother with pigs and cassowaries. No, I shot her with an
                                    arrow and got her for free. I’m not boasting.” The mother
                                    returned, stood outside and heard the father talking. She became
                                    irate. The poor mother felt ashamed and cried loudly. Later, she
                                    went inside and gave her breast to the boy. She cooked food and
                                    they ate. After eating, she told them to stay while she went to
                                    the latrine. The mother went outside, took the ginger and went
                                    back to her home. They waited and the boy cried. The father
                                    called and called, but there was no reply. They slept, then in
                                    the morning, the father went outside and saw that the place had
                                    become entirely forested. There was no garden and no animals.
                                    The place looked very bad. They were very hungry. The father was
                                    all right, but the baby was near death. One night, the mother
                                    cooked two taro corms and carried them to them. Near the door,
                                    she put a big pile of feces and put the two taro corms on top of
                                    the feces. In the morning, they woke up and saw this, but they
                                    were famished. So, the father washed the taros and they ate
                                    them. After a while, the woman felt sorry for them, so she
                                    returned with the ginger and all of the good things returned.
                                    The three of them lived there until the ends of their lives.

                              <p> Once there was a young man who followed a river into the forest.
                                    He walked and walked, and he saw a very beautiful young woman.
                                    However, it was not a real woman, it was a <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span> that had
                                    turned into a woman. She was on top of a stone and making a net
                                    bag. The man saw this woman and trembled. He said, “Ha ha, now
                                    I’11 go grab that woman and bring her home. I shall marry her.”
                                    After he said this, he hid well and approached quietly. The
                                    fishwoman on top of the stone saw him. She left the net bag on
                                    the stone, then turned into a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> and jumped back into the
                                    river. The man was irate and angrily went back home. He took the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span>
                                    -woman’s net bag. This net bag was very beautiful, so he thought
                                    that he could not display the fishwoman’s net bag. It would be
                                    bad if he told his story and the others stole his woman. He did
                                    not tell his friends or brothers his story. The next morning, he
                                    forgot his thoughts and wanted to go to his garden. However, he
                                    saw the net bag again and said, “Never mind the garden. I’ll go
                                    down to the river and look for my <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> -woman.” He quickly went
                                    upriver. His thoughts of grabbing the <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> -woman returned, so he said,
                                    “I’ll quickly hide very close to where she made her net bag,
                                    then I’ll grab her.” He ran and hid very near the stone where
                                    the woman had made the net bag. He did not make any noise while
                                    he was hiding. He looked up and down the water. As he watched, a
                                    very big <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish </span>
                                    jumped up on the sandy shore and immediately turned into a
                                    beautiful young woman. She went up to the stone where the man
                                    was hiding. Oh my, the man did not wait any longer. He quickly
                                    grabbed her. The poor woman screamed and said, “Leave me. Leave
                                    me. I’m not a woman, I’m a <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> fish </span> from the river. It would be
                                    bad if you killed me.” The man said, “No. You’re my woman. I see
                                    your face, hands, hair, legs and breasts and I’m troubled.
                                    Please, I won’t kill you or rape you. Please, I’ll marry you.
                                    Please tell me the truth and I’ll bring you home.” They talked
                                    and talked until their mouths hurt. It was nearly dark and the
                                    woman was sorry for the man. She said, “My man, if you truly
                                    love me, then take me and marry me. You must never bring me near
                                    the river. If you don’t do this, then you will be sorry and cry
                                    for me.” The man said that he understood. They married and lived
                                    very happily together in the man’s village. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there were two men who lived in two villages, Paup and
                                    Yakamul [Ali People, West Sepik Province]. The men’s names were
                                    Sabaou and Rako. Sabaou lived in Paup Village and Rako lived in
                                    Yakamul Village. Sabaou did not know that Rako lived in Yakamul.
                                    One time, Sabaou went to a mountain and called out his own name.
                                    On the other side of the mountain, Rako stood up and called out
                                    his own name. Rako was a hunter. In Rako’s area, there was
                                    plentiful wild game, such as pigs, cassowaries, marsupials
                                    (sikau), and various kinds of birds. Rako was married, but he
                                    did not have children. Poor Sabaou, there was no wild game in
                                    his area. He always just ate vegetables and sago <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> beetle </span> grubs.
                                    One afternoon when there were no clouds on the mountain, Sabaou
                                    stood on top of the mountain and saw smoke rising from Rako’s
                                    mountain. He thought, “There must be someone on that mountain.”
                                    Later, he thought about going to see who it was that lived over
                                    there. He walked over there and found Rako in Yakamul. He looked
                                    inside Rako’s house and saw that it was jam-packed with meat.
                                    Rako gave some meat to him and he carried it back to his house
                                    in Paup. When Sabaou was about to return home, he told Rako,
                                    “Friend, I think that I would like to come and see you again.”
                                    He did not say when. Another time, Sabaou went to Yakamul to see
                                    Rako, but Rako was not at the house. He had gone to the forest
                                    to hunt game. Only Rako’s wife was home. Sabaou had brought some
                                    vegetables and sago grubs, and he gave them to Rako’s wife. They
                                    were at the house when Sabaou told Rako’s wife that he was
                                    thirsty and wanted to drink some water. Rako’s wife told him
                                    that there was no water at the house. So Sabaou told her, “Go
                                    get some.” The woman urinated in a bucket and brought it to
                                    Sabaou. But Sabaou looked at it and told the woman, “This is not
                                    water. This is your piss in a bucket.” The poor woman went back
                                    again to fetch some real water. The water was far away, about a
                                    mile. While the woman was fetching water, Sabaou stood up and
                                    took a rack of meat, then ran away to Paup. When Rako and his
                                    wife returned home, they did not talk. They just ate vegetables
                                    and sago grubs. Sabaou went to Paup and ate the meat. So now, we
                                    people of Paup Village have more wild game in our forest, and
                                    the people of Yakamul just eat vegetables and insects. If you go
                                    to Aitape in West Sepik Province, and you arrive at Paup, you
                                    can see two mountains called Sabaou and Rako. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was a village with an old man and his wife. The
                                    man was called Yakewe and his wife was called Amayanuwewei. They
                                    had a son named Yagukedi. The two old people worked hard at
                                    taking care of their son, and he became a very big man. One
                                    time, his father and mother told him, “Tomorrow we’ll go to the
                                    forest with you and stay for about two or three weeks.” Their
                                    son said, “Yes papa, that’s good. I too want very much to go and
                                    sleep in the forest so that I’ll be able to find out how to trap
                                    pigs and shoot cassowaries.” The family finished their
                                    preparations and put everything in the part of the canoe that is
                                    called peka in the language spoken at Leitre [Village, Rawo
                                    People, West Sepik Province]. The boy’s father asked his two
                                    co-mothers, “Do you think that we’ll leave the three mountains
                                    and make a house near a big fig tree near a lake?” This lake is
                                    where the cassowaries bathe and where they come to eat the fig
                                    tree fruits. The parents said, “That’s good. We’ll paddle until
                                    the sun sets.” They went inside the canoe and paddled. As they
                                    paddled, the son asked his father, “Are we near or far now?” The
                                    father replied, “It’s still very far. After we pass four river
                                    forks, then we’ll arrive at the place that I spoke of.” After
                                    they passed three forks, the father said, “I’ll tell a story for
                                    you and your mother.” The son said, “OK, father, tell us.” The
                                    old man told them about the time before he was married. He and
                                    his father went to sleep at this place. He dreamt and saw many
                                    thousands of cassowaries running towards the lake. They removed
                                    their skins and became women. He spoke quietly. He dreamt and
                                    saw the beautiful women, but one was more beautiful than all of
                                    the others were. Her skin was lighter, like that of a white
                                    woman. She was the best. The father said that he saw this in his
                                    dream, but he had thought that it was real. Then he got up and
                                    said, “Why did you call out? I told my father that I had dreamt
                                    that I saw something very nice. My father asked me to tell him
                                    whether it was something real that had caused me to call out. I
                                    told my father and then he said, ‘Ha, you ate a lot of <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span> meat
                                    and you just had a dream.’ So father did not believe my story.”
                                    As the three of them were still paddling, the sun began to set.
                                    It was not long when they came to this place. They paddled the
                                    canoe up to a huge boulder. A big flood arose and took the canoe
                                    away. It was night now, and they took their things to a place
                                    and went to make a house. They lit a fire from a big piece of
                                    bamboo, then they made a house from wild limbum leaves. When the
                                    house was finished, the old mother cooked some sago and they ate
                                    it with dried <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> fish
                                    </span> . In the early morning, the boy took his bow and arrows
                                    and went to watch for what his father had told him and his
                                    mother. He believed everything, so he thought that he too would
                                    see this. As he was thinking, he felt the ground shake and he
                                    heard a loud noise coming from a mountain. He was terrified, and
                                    he trembled. But he thought back to the story and said, “I can’t
                                    be afraid because if this really happens, I will really see it
                                    with my own eyes.” So he went and hid at the base of a tree and
                                    watched. It was not long when he saw many cassowaries running,
                                    removing their skins and jumping into this lake. He watched and
                                    saw a very beautiful woman. Her skin was like coconut meat. He
                                    said, “Oh my, what can I do to get this beautiful woman?” He
                                    crawled on his hands and knees and he zigzagged towards them.
                                    The women did not see him, so he quickly took the beautiful
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> cassowary </span>
                                    ’s skin. After he took the skin, he quickly fled on his hands
                                    and knees back to the base of the fig tree. When he arrived at
                                    the fig tree, he shouted and shouted. The women were surprised
                                    and ran to get their <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          cassowary </span> skins. They put them on and ran away,
                                    but the beautiful woman did not find her skin, so she was very
                                    ashamed and sat and cried. The boy came out of hiding and asked
                                    her, “Hey, why are you crying? Don’t cry. Come with me and we’ll
                                    go to my home on the beach.” So, the woman stopped crying and
                                    said, “I’m ashamed because I don’t have a bark skirt.” The boy
                                    told her to wait and he would go ask his mother to give him a
                                    bark skirt, then he would bring it to her. He ran and told his
                                    parents to bring him a bark skirt. They looked at him and gave
                                    him a bark skirt. Later he married this woman. The four of them
                                    returned home and they lived well together. The young boys of
                                    this village saw the beautiful woman. They were very troubled,
                                    and they lusted for her [lit., “swallowed their spit”]. This
                                    story is too long, so I will stop now after the first part. </p>

                              <p> Long ago, there was a clan in Wabag [Town, Enga People, Enga
                                    Province]. The name of this clan was Depau. They lived there a
                                    long time. One day a man said, “I’m just living here and I’m
                                    tired of it. I want to go to the forest.” After he said this, he
                                    took his bow, arrows and things, then went into the forest. The
                                    Depau Clan waited and waited, but this man did not return. Three
                                    days passed, and another man went into the forest to find him.
                                    He walked and walked, trying to find him while the other men
                                    waited and waited. However, the second man did not return
                                    either. Another man went to try to find them. The people waited
                                    and waited for three days. Then a fourth man said that he would
                                    go try to find the other men. He went and he did not return,
                                    making it four men who did not return. The whole Depau Clan
                                    decided to go and find these four men. They told one man to
                                    stay. This man did not own a single <span style="color: red;"
                                          type="animal"> pig </span> or anything else worthwhile. He
                                    was a complete pauper. So, he stayed and the other men went into
                                    the forest. He waited for an entire month, but the men did not
                                    return. He waited and said that he would go to find the other
                                    men. The worthless man departed. He walked and walked into the
                                    very deep forest. He heard singing coming from somewhere in the
                                    forest. He walked towards the place where the singing was
                                    originating. He arrived there and saw many women singing and
                                    talking in a garden. The man looked carefully at them and he saw
                                    a beautiful woman among them. This woman was more beautiful than
                                    the others were. He watched as they went to get some water to
                                    drink. He thought and thought about how he could get this woman.
                                    He thought some more, then he thought that he would become a
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> mosquito </span>
                                    and go inside the beautiful woman’s belly. He quickly went
                                    inside her belly. She told the other women, “Something has gone
                                    inside my belly.” She waited for one month, then she felt as if
                                    she was pregnant. After two months, she gave birth to a boy. The
                                    other women asked her, “Where did you marry a man that caused
                                    you to give birth to a baby?” The woman told them, “I didn’t
                                    marry a man. I just gave birth.” The boy grew up and lived with
                                    them. The boy saw many taro plants and he marked one for
                                    himself. He told his mother, “When you dig up the taro corms,
                                    the taro that I marked is mine.” After a while, the women said
                                    that the next day they would dig up the taros. So the little boy
                                    took a stick and went to the taro that he had marked and began
                                    to dig the ground around the taro plant. After he dug the ground
                                    around the taro plant, he went back to his house. In the
                                    morning, they went to dig the taros, and the little boy went to
                                    remove his taro. When he was removing his taro, he watched it
                                    break apart. He cried and cried. He began in the morning and was
                                    still at working it in the afternoon, after the others were
                                    finished. His mother saw this and lovingly said, “Stop crying.
                                    Let’s go home.” The little boy asked her, “Where is your home?”
                                    His mother told him, “My father lives there. When we go to my
                                    home, you’ll see my father.” The little boy finished his small
                                    task, then happily ran and ate some taro. He filled his belly
                                    and went to sleep. In the morning, he awoke and told his mother,
                                    “Wake up and we’ll go to your home.” His mother woke up and took
                                    their things, then they walked towards her home. They walked and
                                    walked, then arrived at the mother’s home. The woman’s father
                                    saw the child and asked him, “Whose child is this?” The woman
                                    said, “This is my son.” The woman’s father was very happy. After
                                    they stayed there for two days, the mother told the boy, “Stay
                                    with your grandpa and I’ll go to the garden.” So, the boy stayed
                                    with his grandfather at home. While they stayed there, the
                                    grandfather told him, “You just stay and play here. Don’t go in
                                    back of the house.” This made the boy think hard, so he played
                                    and played there. But he tricked his grandfather and went in
                                    back of the house. He went there and saw [another] house. This
                                    house was beautiful and it was very neatly kept. He went closer
                                    and saw a group of men from his village there. The men saw this
                                    little boy and liked him right away. They thought that he was
                                    another boy, but this little boy already knew that is was just
                                    the Depau Clan. He left them there, then ran in back of the
                                    house. He saw a beautiful multi-colored tree. He quickly ran
                                    back to his grandfather’s house, took an axe and went back to
                                    cut the tree. He cut the tree once then sap shot out of it. He
                                    cut the tree a second time and it fell right over. The tree fell
                                    directly on top of his grandfather’s house, killing him. After
                                    the old man died, the door of the men’s house opened up. The men
                                    went out of the house. At that time, the little boy turned into
                                    the [worthless] man from the village. The men saw his face; some
                                    of them were happy and some of them cried. They thought that
                                    they were going to stay there until they were dead, but this man
                                    had come and helped them. Later, they went back to their home
                                    and saw their wives and children in the village. This story is
                                    from the days of yore when this ghost wanted to finish off all
                                    of the men, but this worthless man tricked the ghost, so that
                                    now there are still people. </p>

                              <p> Long, long ago, Large Red Ant and Little Lizard were very good
                                    friends. One time, they talked about going to hunt some wild
                                    game in the forest. One morning, very early, they woke up and
                                    went to the forest. They walked and walked, and Little Lizard
                                    saw a <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> .
                                    Lizard walked quietly and swiftly, grabbing the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> . Lizard
                                    had caught the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> and called out to its friend. Lizard’s friend, Ant,
                                    quickly ran over to them. Ant jumped up and went right into the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> ’s
                                    eye. The <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> ant </span>
                                    urinated into the <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig
                                    </span> ’s eye, and the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          pig </span> died immediately. The two friends pulled the
                                          <span style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> over
                                    to a river. They made a big earth oven for the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> . While
                                    they were cooking the <span style="color: red;" type="animal">
                                          pig </span> in the earth oven, Lizard told Ant that they
                                    should go and wash. They arrived at the river and Lizard told
                                    Ant, “Let’s throw a stone into the river, then we’ll try to swim
                                    down and get it.” Ant was the first to try. But poor Ant was not
                                    heavy, so Ant just drifted on top of the water. Ant could not
                                    swim beneath the water. After a while, it was Little Lizard’s
                                    turn. Lizard just jumped down into the water and swam
                                    underneath, then Lizard went to the place where they had made
                                    the earth oven. Lizard jumped on top, then started to eat the
                                    pork, just leaving the bones. Lizard finished eating, then went
                                    back to Ant. They had been bathing for a long time. They began
                                    to feel hungry, so they ran directly to their earth oven. They
                                    arrived at the place of the earth oven, but only the <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> pig </span> bones and
                                    stones were there. Lizard jumped and asked its friend, Ant,
                                    “Hey, who ate all of the pork?” Lizard was the one who had
                                    actually left the bones and stones. Ant said, “I think it was
                                    just you who ate all of the meat.” However Lizard said, “I think
                                    it was just you who ate it, because I was swimming in the water
                                    to get the stone.” Ant was irate and said, “I think it was just
                                    you. You swam underneath the water, then came out, ate and
                                    returned to me.” Poor Ant was famished. What Ant had said to its
                                    friend, Lizard, made Lizard angry. Lizard wanted to eat Ant, but
                                    Lizard’s little friend was very smart. Ant jumped up and
                                    urinated directly into Lizard’s eye. Lizard was in pain and Ant
                                    quickly fled a tree. When Ant reached the crown of the tree, it
                                    made a nest from tree leaves. [This is the weaver <span
                                          style="color: red;" type="animal"> ant </span> ,
                                    Oecophylla smaragdina (Holldobler and Wilson, 1990: 618, plates
                                    22 and 24).] After building the nest, Ant hid well. Lizard was
                                    afraid of Ant and did not want to follow Ant to the crown of the
                                    tree. Lizard just slept at the base of the tree. So now you can
                                    see that large red ants make leaf nests on top of trees, and
                                    that lizards often hide under leaves at the bases of trees. </p>
